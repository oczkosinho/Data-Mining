"Trying to cancel subscription during free trial of app extremely difficult"
"I have an Apple Watch 5 with Apple care that has a faulty battery ( lasts about 4 hours). Apple will not replace battery unless I pay over £300 for a new screen as there is a scratch on it.  Scratch can hardly be seen and makes no difference.  Appalling customer service and now taking Apple to the ombudsman."
"I’m scratching my head trying to figure out how they have such good products but such poor customer service and order processing. I can’t even begin to explain the nightmare dealing with apple.com, their representatives and their shipping issues. Samsung help!!"
"I went to the Apple store in Roosevelt field mall and the service was horrible.. I went to get me battery changed.. nothing is wrong with my phone since I purchased it, I’ve always used a LifeProof case protecting the phone from any water or damage itself.. The rep said because this phone is dated and there is a speaker problem, and there seems there is signs of liquid but everything is working and they cannot replace the battery.. that o was paying for.. then offered me a new iPhone X for $550.. you see what big companies do to make a dollar"
"DO NOT ORDER FROM APPLE.COM!!!EXTREMELY inaccurate delivery times - They WILL NOT deliver on the estimated date but WAY later. I thought I could trust them but they are literally a scam! If I knew I had to wait THIS LONG for my Ipad, I would aNot have ordered from them. It's an outrage. Do not order from here. Find their products somewhere else."
"I wish there was a way to give a zero score! Apple is absolutely the worst! My apple account was hacked and over $1100 came out of my account. I called Apple and they said oh it looks like you were hacked and requested a refund. Denied! I tried to go into my Apple account and the password wouldn't work. Called Apple, they said oh we need to change the whole account because someone has hacked your account. We did this and the person with apple put in an appeal on the denial. This lady told me with all of the proof I was hacked it should be no problem getting my money back. NOPE! Denied! I called back asked for management. That's a laugh! The management said there are no notes or reason why they won't refund my money. ""Clearly it shows you were hacked"" she said. But there's nothing else we can do because after an appeal it's done. She said maybe try to get your bank to get the money back for you. Of course I am!!! I will never in my life do anything else with Apple and I would strongly suggest that no one else do either. They do not care about their customers. Here it is Christmas, my bank account is drained and being a customer of Apple for many years to get treated like this!!! Nope!! I will tell every single person how sorry Apple is from this day on!! Everyday!!! Every person I see!!! So if a crazy lady comes up to you on the street and starts telling you about apple........it's me!!"
"I sent in my IPad Pro which was under warranty as it had a small crack and I got sent a defective replacement that the screen flickers black on one corner. Since I received it and before I noticed the original warranty expired and now they want to charge me to send it back amd repair it. Simply despicable!!"
"Applied for an Apple Card to purchase IWatches for Christmas gifts. Made the order on line with the help on an Apple Representative and went through the steps to charge my purchase with my new Apple Card. Later that day, after wrapping my gifts and putting them under the tree. I received a text from my bank of the purchase from apple on my debit card. After NUMEROUS calls and getting disconnected 3 times, they cannot do anything to help. I would have to unwrap and return to an Apple location to credit and rebill. They line was extremely long when I made my appointment to pickup my order, 45 minutes in line after my scheduled appointment and they want me to go back! I have been a loyal apple customer with numerous iphones, ipads and other products. By far this has been the worst experience I have ever had! there will not be any more purchases from apple for me!!!!Buyer Beware!"
"Terrible customer service , I placed an order and cancelled, it’s more than 45 days now calling on a daily basis and still haven’t received my money back"
"Got powerbeats pro from Apple and all I can say is that they're awesome. Stay in the ear, good bass, good sound and comfy af. I recommend you all to buy from these guys. They don't disappoint with their headphones that they sell."
"Ordered the Apple Airpods Max. I'm in Canada. Expected delivery was December 16th. Apple sent the shipment out with UPS and 2 days later it was being returned to sender. Spoke to Apple support. They let me know it was being returned to sender because Apple mislabeled the package and did not place a Hazmat sticker on it. Same thing happened to a couple of my friends who ordered in Canada as well.When I spoke to Sam G. (one of the worst customer service reps I have ever spoken to by the way. Extremely condescending. Steve Jobs would be rolling in his grave if he knew Sam G. worked for his company), he let me know my package that was returned to the warehouse would not be sent back out to me but I would be placed back in a Priority Queue. That ""Priority Queue"" is showing an expected ship date between March 17th - 31st. When I told Sam G. about this, he pretty told me to suck it up and that Apple was incapable of of relabeling my headphones because they're incompetent and are no longer the innovators of tech that they were.A company that used to be at the forefront of the tech world, retail design and customer service should not employ a service person of Sam G.'s standards and I would have gotten better service from an outsourced call centre in Asia. Thank you Sam G. for being a shining beacon of everything that is wrong with Apple today. I truly wish you a bah humbug."
"I recently called as I wanted to reset the computer to factory specs. The first person I spoke to sent me in circles. We erased the hard drive but only then did she realize that we needed my WiFi to download.  She turned me over to an “expert” that didn’t know what she was talking about either. I decided to scrap the computer and just buy a new one. Of course it is not an Apple product and I will never buy another one again."
"Apple can't deliver orders they have taken money for, give false promises for fulfilment of orders and show a total contempt for their customers.One star for their performance is too flattering."
"I bought a iphone 12 on line from apple and returned my iphone 11 in the box they provided for a 350 refund.  apple claimed the iphone i returned was only worth 150 vs the 350 and returned a different iphone to me when i declined offer.  after investigation they said to reach out to police.  bottom line- do not buy a new iphone from apple on line.  go to your carrier or an  apple store.  there is a bigger scam in here. especially when i have the serial # for the phone i returned to apple and the serial is different from the phone they returned."
"I can’t be more ashamed of your customer service and support especially during Christmastime. I ordered W######### for Christmas presents. Then I received the leather cases blue andsaddle brown and returned with your emailed label to FedEx. I wasn’t notified when returned onDecember 12, 2020 that it would be there on December 15, 2020, I was notified on December16, 2020 that your shipment was not accepted and another attempt will be on December 16,2020 delaying the refund. I have sat on hold for hours at a time to cancel the Macbook 16 inchfor my son. I never received it and canceled it before shipment. I was notified on December 16,2020 by Kiesha your customer support that I needed to return it before I can get a refund whenclearly it was not sent to begin with. I asked for a supervisor and she ended the call making mewait to call back and sit on hold again. I also spoke to technical support whom I told her to beginwith this is an issue she needs to transfer as she can’t help me. I spoke to a Jeff who was asupervisor in sales department who put me on hold to check on these issues and told me I was“condescending” After these dealings of sitting on the phone for hours and not getting anywhereshe also hung up on me and said i swore and disconnected the call. Your employees feel theycan treat customers any way they want to because you have no complaint department and noway to speak to anyone higher than these so called supervisors that treat customers likegarbage. I told Luther another supervisor about this issue and he said it would be a pendingcharge on my card, which was charged to my card on December 9, 2020. Your website showsthat I was getting a refund in the amount of $189.74 for the leather case which was not openednor altered; it was still in the same package it was shipped. I see that Apple is trying to get oneof my returns to an apple card which I paid for on my credit card and should be applied directlyto my credit card. I don’t see what the problem is because they were both shipped FedEx andnot opened or altered in any way. I am terribly concerned with your company's return policy andthe way that they are doing things. I was also charged a fee of $2.40 by Apple that has noexplanation as to what these fees were. It should be a simple transaction that has turnedridiculously complicated for no purpose. I also was notified by Luther that they have received thepackages that were returned and that it will take 5-7 business days for the refund, when yourpolicy states it will be refunded when you receive the items in question. I am saddened that yourcompany is turning into another chaotic corporate monopoly where customers don’t matter. Iasked for an explanation as to what these charges on my credit card from Apple were andcouldn’t seem to get anyone to explain what the exact charges are for. I would like a responseand not your “sorry about my inconvenience”. Luther stated I was acting………...but wouldn’tfinish because what he was about to say was probably not going to be professional. If you wanta successful business you should listen to your customers, not make them wait on hold forhours! I would like to say that Jeeah is another ridiculous employee that you have. I would startby changing your customer support if you care anything about your customers."
"I got the AirPod Pro as a gift in July 2020. The AirPod Pro right earbud has an issue, is not charging. I have called Apple Tech Support to tell them my AirPod right earbud is not charging. I have given them the Serial number, they said my AirPod Pro had been fixed before. I say never been served, I got it brand new. They ask me to provide a receipt, I have told them, got this for a gift don’t have a receipt. They said can’t do anything about this. So I decided to call Apple Store to make an appointment to see Tech Support in person. They mixed up with my appointment, it took me two days to get my appointment. Finally, I have an appointment coming to see Apple Tech Support. I did Explain the issue. He take a look at AirPod and say this product is not Apple Product. He said they can not do anything about it. But I have checked Airpod Pro connected to my iPhone the information says it made from Apple Manufacture Inc. I think Apple company they rather take the customer's money instead of solving the problem. Apple products are a really expensive product than others, but they not trying to help the customer out to solve the problem, that’s terrible customer service."
"Apple Store Bentall Centre Kingston Upon Thames UK  guys please avoid this Apple store very very unprofessional and unethical kind of business is done in this store.What they promise and what they deliver can't be trusted.Few of the staff members with whom i interacted was unprofessional,disrespectful and hyper in their tone and body language it's like they are doing some sort of favour on their customers.Apple products and their services are completely rip off ,the quality of the products are deteriorating as same as the deterioration of their customer services .All in all this will be my last buy with Apple and a high recommendation to everyone to stay away Apple .I would definitely like to escalate this to the higher authorities from Apple reading my post."
"got the iphone 12 pro max and its amazing can not fault it one bit"
"I recently got the iPhone 11 IT SUCKS!!! I’ve never had so many damn problems with my iPhone as much as I do now. It’s awful quality it glitches,lags, and shuts off out of no where! It’s stupid."
"Apple has pushed me over the edge - I will switch to another company as soon as my phone and laptop need replacement. This was triggered by them blocking my iTunes account without warnings. Now I was 100% at fault for not remembering security questions I set up probably around 10 years ago. In my defense, I have never been asked beforehand.  But they will not take any proof (ID, Passport, Proof of address, etc.) to get the account unlocked or offer a real solution except for Remember your Security questions. And they wanted to see invoices from the Apple devices I bought years ago. Now I am so fed up with their call centre turning in circles and their solution is to have to create a new ID, uninstall the existing and even though they claim I can transfer all purchases (audiobooks etc.) I bet that won't happen. Apple has lost its edge - it was easier to transfer the entirety of the money to buy my flat via online banking. I had far fewer security issues! So disappointed and not the Apple I remember and enjoyed. Sadly it will take years"
"Acknowledging this is 1st world problem- but it is an expensive item! It’s only around six weeks old and the screen is really scratched. I work from home, I haven’t worn it to do manual labour or have done anything to knowingly scratch it. Previous watch was a series4, didn’t have this and gave my series3 to teen daughter and it’s immaculate. Suggests to me quality of screen has reduced in line with increase in price."
"Can’t access my emails yet again. Am not the most patient male but it’s getting ridiculous now. Still waiting for a call back."
"Why has Apple become such an inferior outfit???   I’ve always had iPhones but overtime the updates are more and more frequent and they usually mess something up!!!!I expect more from such a high profile organization but it does seem to be on a sliding slope.  The last update messed up my keyboard which now has a huge delay when I’m typing messages (ie: iMessages).   It’s been a month with no notification of an upcoming fix.  From forums it does appear Apple is not concerned.  Well good by Apple products.  I will dump them and definitely pass along my recommendations to others to stay away from Apple!!!"
"I thought my screen froze and it chipped but it’s doing well, one downside is my phone case and the back of my phone broke they are kinda weak"
"Horrible horrible customer service. Trying to return my iphone for 2 weeks now and all that O need is return label since all apple stores are closed due to covid. Every agent tells me something different each time. Spent at least 5 hours on the phone for nothing. Impossible to speak to a manager. Very disappointed and very angry. This company sucks!"
"This company has no passion for its customers just after your money worst staff they can’t hear you understand you pass the buckle they owe me refund for AirPod still have not got it it’s over 6 months"
"I ordered HP printer from Apple on line. It was delivered with NO SET-UP CARTRIDGES. When I called Apple they said I could take it back to an Apple store. Then they emailed me coupon for 15.00 off another Apple order of 100.00 or more. I had to buy my own cartridges for 85.00. What a rip."
"I am terribly disappointed with Appel. I have an i-Pad, Model MD512TY/A, with a software version 10.3.3 that cannot be updated because Apple does not allow me to. The worst thing is that I cannot download certain apps because they require an updates version of the i-Pad software. I understand Appel  pushing users/customers to buy new devices but this should not be the way of doing it."
"I’m so frustrated with my new I phone 12 pro. no changer nothing comes with it. no more apple products !"
"Well, I'm pretty unhappy with the recent iOS update 14.2, ruined my iPad 5th Gen. When I contacted the CS, they did nothing, and every time they just advise to reset & clear the iPad! Should we format our devices each time they release a buggy new update??!!"
"We absolutely love Apple. All our products are from them & we simply can't get enough of Apple!nerds-agency.com"
"Today I purchased something on app store by mistake and as I was trying to unpurchase it. Your f**King system wouldn't even let me. all you want is my f**king money, you're not even helping anyone but yourself, I don't know what people see in this stupid company of yous but I'm done with this s**t."
"My husband and I bought I phone12 64 mgb in Queens Center Mall in NY,not knowing that his current usage capacity is already over 90’s.Upset that we were not guided by the sales clerk who sold us and we feel he’s much concern in getting another sales .So We went back right away after finding the problem. We’re expecting a fight or a heated argument from the staff but to our surprise Manfred gave us an excellent service . He patiently listened to us ,then guided us with our purchases . I can see he loves his job and it shows on how he deals with us. I wish there’s more like him here in NYC."
"Don't you think less people will buy AirPods and iPhones if there's a limit on how loud they can go? I was gonna get AirPods till this happened. I also stopped using iTunes. I pray someone comes out with a good phone , Android isn't much better... oh also my phone doesn't charge! Rarely will it charge - some kind of OS issue. I have to use another cheap phone as a spare. That shouldn't be necessary in a $1000 phone. Cmon guys wat kind of Drugs are u on? Can u cut down? Make a phone that works better"
"Hi just wanted to share my experience with everyone that doesn’t know about AirPod pro common fault!!!!!!I bought AirPods Pro last year of 2019 and had them a week  over the warranty when they started crackling I called them and they said your warranty ended last week . I then went online and to my amazement these AirPod pros are not what everyone is saying they are but are 249£ worth of disposable headphones that only last a year if your lucky .(check forum of this fault online )Should of listened to my freind and bought 10£ pair in Thailand 😂. In fact his are still working to this day and mine need throwing away . Apple is not a quality product but a count the penny for a pound company . After this experience I’m giving apple a wide birth as they are a greedy no caring useless product company who doesn’t even care about any reviews"
"Empty of empathy is how I would describe the customer service within the Apple Braehead store. Don’t waste your time, all they do is follow scripts. Fail to admit what is broke and fob you off."
"I ordered the new iPhone in Nov and was told I would receive it form the 24th to the 4th Dec . On the 24th I was told that the phone was with dpd the carrier and I would be contacted when it was being delivered . When we didn’t hear anything else we contacted dpd who told us to contact Apple , Apple said they are now in dispute with dpd over the lost phone and I will have to wait after taking my 1100 pounds and waiting over 10 days for them to ring us about this matter It’s not good enough . What happend to customer service it’s not good enough saying that your in dispute with the carrier  I have paid for goods I haven’t received . Ordinarily I wouldn’t have ordered on line but at the time we were in lock down so couldn’t go to the shops . Apple should have sent a phone out to me next day delivery not make me wait until their dispute was settled that wasn’t the customer s fault and I’m still waiting for my phone."
"THEY CHARGE ME $750 FOR A REPAIR ON A LAPTOP COMPUTER 2012 THATS IS OUT OF WARRANTY JUST FOR A NEW LOGIC BOARD APPLE IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY and they WANT YOU TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER JUST TO SCAM YOU DONT TRUST APPLE FOR REPAIR"
"So I buy 3 iPhones for the family and all the chargers and earbuds since those are not included anymore! The salesperson asks me do you need a bag???  Yes! So she said the bag costs 5 cents!!! Now I can spend thousands of dollars on your product and you have the balls to charge me 5 cents for a paper Bag??? I guess this is what they mean by being nickeled and dimed to death!!!  @apple You need to work on the customer experience!!!"
"Magsafe charger description is misleading. Apple claims it is a faster way of charging an iPhone. This is true for iPhone 12 series. They say it is compatible with earlier models. BUT DO NOT SAY THAT IT CHARGES MUCH MORE SLOWLY.Had this been made clear I would NOT have bought this item."
"Their customer service is shocking pathetic, you would expect with the amount spent on apple devices, they would be able to spend more on training staff.I've left emails for them to contact me at their requests and nothing. they hardly care about software issues and just assume that the next updates will automatically fix them, guess what, it doesn't. You get 1 star because I cannot gove a zero star rating."
"I have a credit on my apple account relating to a purchase made some years. There was an issue with the item I bought and to cut a long story short, it was returned and another item purchased in its place. The difference in the amount was credited to my apple account. The funds have been sat in my account for some time and i finally decided to use it to purchase some headphones. I am now being told i can only use the credit to purchase music or apps even though they had nothing to do with the original purchase.After being passes from piller to post for well over an hour on the phone, I finally get through to a senior advisor who kept banging on about the terms and condition yet when asked any question could not answer them. What is your companies complains procedure? Are you part of a dispute resolution scheme?What has itunes got to do with an instore purchase?The aswer to all the above is, he didnt have a clue and simply banged on about the terms and condition that where never mentioned in store, nor were any limitationes to the credit mentioned.My advice to apple and the advisor it1.The advisor needs to realise you have 2 ears and 1 mouth and that is because you should do twice the amount of listening than talking.2. If you dont know what your talking about, stop talking.3. Listen to what is being said, instead of repeating the same line like some annoying robot4. Realist its not your money but is the customers.5. Think of your brand rather than getting the last word.6. Ever hang up on a customer simply because your not intelligent enough to process what is being said."
"I contacted Apple Support because I was trying to try out the Apple One plus for one month free during the trial.  The rep from Apple Support told me the wrong information and I ended up unsubscribing and re-subscribed and they charged me for the Apple One plus even though I didn't get the free month trial.  The supervisor could see this and said there's nothing she can do and that I won't be able to get the one month trial free period.  She said she was can refund it so she processed through the refund and said I'll get refunded in 48 hours.  I get an email stating that I don't qualify for a refund.  Then I call back to Apple Support and requested to speak to another supervisor.  The rep had me hold for over 10 minutes and then decides to hang up on me and not call me.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  I'm getting rid of all my Apple products- I'm done with Apple Support."
"Order 10 day ago a get 3 text a day say my shipment status has"
"I am so frustrated and disappointed with Apple Support.  I have an iphone 8 plus.  I tried to add my fingerprint to use as my passcode and I'm not sure what happened but my passcode got changed I couldn't use my fingerprint to open my phone.  After several attempts, I couldn't log back into my phone because it became disabled.  After two phone calls to support and an online chat with support, I won't be able to get any assistance until I receive an email within 24 hours.  I am hard pressed to understand how such an tech savvy company can't help their valued customers in a more timely manner."
"Had a fault with my iPhone 11 Pro Max which  had a faulty ambient light sensor on the screen. I visited my local apple store as the phone was just about to go out of warranty and unfortunately as the phone had an intermittent fault it was ok at the time of my appointment. Due to this the phone wasn’t fixed in the warranty period but when ringing the customer care team after the warranty expired I was pleasantly surprised to see that apple said they would look to repair the phone as the fault was reported in the warranty period. Throughout the repair José looked after me in the customer care team and got the phone send off and returned to me repaired within 2 working days which was great. Faultless service and great aftercare. Just a shame Apple don’t cover warranty for 2 years like most other manufacturers."
"Omar thinks he is the his highest person  in customer service. He doesn’t want to assist with my phone repair. He just wants to get customers off the phone. I’ve wasted well over and hour trying to get his supervisor. And he still wants to play games. I think the next step is to stop buying apple product. I guess Android is going to get a new customer. Still arguing with him about my repair and a phone they have in there possession. Don’t make sense that they can’t mail the replacement out as the broken phone is already in the mail back to them."
"Apples' customer service is virtually non-existent. The arrogance of the customer service agents staffing Apples' telephone customer service in the UK is misplaced and unwarranted. I sought to make a complaint regarding their poor customer service only to be told that there is no complaints system and the best I could hope for was an email telling me I had complained! When I asked for the call to be escalated, they simply ended the call. The operative came across as more interested in trying to impress with faux intelligence rather than than helping to sort out my issue. As a consequence of this and other recent poor Apple experiences, I am switching away from them as a phone and computer provider."
"My iPhone 8 was not powering on during the April 2020. Its warranty was expiring on July 2020. I waited to stores openings to claim the warranty. But the stores was not opened until September. When I tried to claim my warranty after store openings they did not honored the warranty since the limited warranty expired. Basically Apple behaving cheap to lower their warranty covering expenses using Covid 19 Store Closure."
"Following a hard-drive crash, lost ££££s of songs. Can't log in to Apple/Itunes because my email address changed (no password reset) and I couldn't remember ""my first owned and least favourite cars"" - exactly as I typed 10 years ago!After online chat couldn't help, a security call was made - advisor couldn't help as there is no way of resetting anything. A supervisor said the same.Email addresses change and 'security questions' supplied years ago are lost. This BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY CAN NOT HELP.Pathetic, helpless and useless. Avoid."
"HORRIBLE PRICES,HORRIBLE PRODUCTS,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,IF YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY PLEASE BUY APPLE.USELESS PHONES AND LAPTOPS."
"For the price you pay, Apple has terrible customer service and their devices aren't that much better than the previous version. The fact that they tried to force people into phasing out their old phones with software updates says everything you need to know about this company. Steve Jobs would be ashamed of what has happened to this company."
"I order my iPhone 12 pro max on November 3 ,waiting until now not recieved iphone yet.i call in today said my order got cancle .I call service waiting other one hours ."
"I phoned apple to ask which adapter I need to use with my I phone 7plus and tv ( to watch Netflix) advisor said it was £64.95 ( which is a lot) and he e mailed me the link to order! I ordered from the link and it’s arrived today to big!! Does not fit!!! So dissatisfied I now have the hassle of returning and still don’t know which adapter I need!!! POOR SERVICE inconvenience due to incorrect advise!!"
"I order iphone 12 64gb online through apple store .i was. Expected delievery on friday still havent received my iphone .the Lady april whom i spoke giving me suggestion they will investigate itwill take 12 days and then they will come for a solution.i m realy disapointed with service when u pay so much money to buy a phone.if appledoesnt have phone they should take order when they cant deliever on time"
"When you pay high price for a premium product you expect to get it on time. Not only didn't arrive on time, but 3 days latter I am still waiting. I tried to call the carrier and no answer after waiting for more than half an hour. Website doesn't give any update or any valuable info.Then I called apple and they said is not apple's fault but carrier. The only solution apple gave me after expending more than an hour talking to them is to open an investigation, that will take 12 days!! to get resolved and then they will tell me something. Seriously? I ordered from apple so yes, it's apple fault to contract this carrier.unbelievable."
"I've had quite a few Apple product over quite a few years. Even though can be a little overpriced they seem to be  good quality products that have served and lasted well.Any issues I have raised have either been resolved extremely well and quickly or terrible with no resolution. I think it depends on what the issue is and/or how you go about contacting Apple or/and could depend on who you get through to."
"Recently purchased my 4th iPhone, online from Apple. Their website hypes how simple, quick  and safe their no contact delivery is. What a joke— no contact is really problematic when next day delivery rolls into a week of waiting —despite robo messages telling you otherwise. Oh, good luck talking to a courteous person with knowledge."
"Bought an iPhone 12 pro max and some accessories direct from apple (first time buying the phone direct rather than a network contract) got told it would be here in 3 weeks, got an update to say it would be delivered a week earlier which I was over the moon about. I recently got a brand new Apple Mac mini which when it came was faulty, went online and instead of getting a replacement I have requested a refund, the process is so easy to do as you can have a currier come to your house and collect it. Also their customer service is spot on, accidentally wiped my MacBook Air, requested a call from apple support and within 2 minutes I had a call and was connected to an agent who put me through to a lady called Jessica who took me through it step by step, was very patient with me and was a pleasure to speak to. My issue was fixed within the hour which was very important since I use my MacBook to work from home. Don't understand all the bad reviews on here as I have always found them good and wouldn't use any other phones/computers"
"I have contacted Apple twice regarding multiple problems with my new 12 Pro Max phone.  My third contact blames my carrier.  The carrier blames Apple.The new iPhone 12 Pro Max is defective and certainly not ready for Prime Time.  Wait for the 13 or go Samsung."
"Disaster service!! They ruined by phone service my cell for lack of wisdom. ANDDDD I didn’t erase my contacts WAS the last update from Apple iPhone also the upgrade from iPhone made super slow my celular internet."
"I hope I can give 0 rating. I used to be a huge apple fan since the first iPhone, my first MacBook Air was used for 10 years with 0 issues. But apple has changed.I bought a MacBook Pro 13” 2017 in 3 years the computer shut down and stop working, $2500 computer for 3 years. no warranty now. I sent my MacBook to Apple to repair, first day they said it was a battery issue and it will cost me $300, and the next day they said they need to replace my logic board and that brings the cost to $1000 - with $1000 you can buy a decent windows PC.Then I went down a rabbit hole of logic board fixing - just like H&M and Zara, they would rather create more landfills and pollute the environment than building long lasting products. I am so disgusted by the consumerism and capitalism. Apple is the highest valued company in the world and they has more than 35% profit margin because of your support. I don't know how anyone works at Apple can sleep at night. They intentionally designed the hardware in an integrated way to make it harder to repair. Don't be a fool and fall for their traps. I’m definitely no longer buying or recommending Apple products."
"Very disappointing service from Apple, I have been a big fan of the company since the launch of the 1st iPhone. I think now I debate if I should move to Android or Samsung. So my Mac Pro crash after doing an update of the new OS big sur, even thou my max was purchased exactly 1 year and 6 days prior. Over the phone while speaking to 4 differently senior CS members on different occasion, I was told it’s probably my internet, hardware, the time and blah blah blah... even though I explained it’s fibre optic broadband, perfectly working on other devices, hardware is in perfect condition as it’s barely used (unless apple decided to breaks down, because it’s rarely used) anyway, apple decided to take the max pro in for repair (complimentary bases) which I am happy about, repair was done and the item was shipped from Europe to U.K via ups, however, the repair (mac pro) was supposed to arrive yesterday between 10-2pm, which never happened. After ringing UPS (5 times and every time told different story) I decided to ring apple and ask, can you please find out from UPS where my repair is? “And did you insurance this when it was shipped” as if it’s lost then I need to no who is going to replace my missing Mac Pro. The answer from the lovely lady I spoke to “I have spoken to my manager and we are unable to do anything for you, as it was shipped from us” Even though it’s not the persons fault who was helping me at apple, the manager should have known better. Firstly, it is your responsibility until my repaired item reaches me. As you are shipping it, if you have used a useless company such as UPS to save money on your services, then surely you should be little concerned that your customer item hasn’t been returned on time and UPS are unable to tell where it is. Even thou I have screenshots from the delivery states when it was suppose to be arriving. I feel that Apple is got far to big for its shoes and is unable to offer good customer service. Worse of all it can’t even take responsibility of locating where my repair is."
"Awful customer service that actually lies to you and now they drop my calls by saying they ""temporarily can't handle my call"". I placed an order with express delivery but it has never arrived, I first contacted them to ask what happened and they said it was guaranteed to be delivered today between 6pm and 7pm and made a big song and dance of it. It was not delivered and now when I call the support line I just get droppedI wish I had gone elsewhere since going direct to apple is a massive waste of time having to phone up their support just to get lied to"
"I’m very disappointed with the service I’ve had with apple. I got my contract with BT for a iPhone XR 64GB in red in September 2020. I’ve accidentally cracked the screen, so the phone now has multiple cracks going across the screen. I understand that although under warranty as only 3 months old at this point, accidental damage isn’t covered so Ive taken out applecare+ Which should cover everything. I’ve spoken to a few people over the phone from apple who have advised me that I can get a replacement as I have apple care+. I was happy and thought this would be the best thing to do. I got the agent I spoke to on the phone to confirm this could definitely be done to which they said it could be.So I live in Peterborough UK and the nearest shop is Cambridge, that’s at least 30 odd miles or so away from me, nonetheless, I drove to the apple store with appointment of course, only to be told that the phone can’t be replaced, but only repaired.I don’t really understand, applecare is basically irrelevant if your looking for a replacement.. being offered a repair and having to wait at least 5 days for them to fix the screen in my iPhone and from what I’ve heard with people taking the phone in for repairs and being told that the phone was previously opened so insurance is void etc etc, no thanks"
"I don't know what has happened to Apple but it isn't the same.  I placed an order online and had a problem with it that kept me from getting the order completed properly.I called and ended up talking to 5 people at Apple not one actually listened, not one sounded like they cared in any way shape or form and when I said well I will just not get the item at this point I don't want it. Horrible...it is making me question whether my loyalty has exceeded their commitment to good customer service."
"They block your emails if you don’t pay £0.79 a month for storage.Blocked over 1000+ of my emails (unretrievable). Pathetic"
"The title says it all. From using slaves to make their phones to banning the user from having the right to repair their device's, Apple are up there as one of the worst companies around."
"In September, 2020. I had a very disappointing experience with Apple. My wife and I bought an iPad in December 2019. In August of 2020, the iPad developed wide lines on its screen, making it virtually unusable. We had not dropped the iPad or damaged it in any way. Even though the iPad was under warranty, we were charged $249 to repair it. We contacted Apple and asked that the $249 repair charge be waived. Apple refused to do so. At the time, I felt that I had been treated unfairly by Apple, but that there was nothing else that I could do. I recently came to the conclusion that I should share my experience with others so that they could be aware of the risks they are taking when purchasing Apple products.Here, in more detail, is what happened to me. The text below is from a letter that I wrote to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, on September 5, 2020.On August 30, 2020, I noticed that there were two intersecting lines (not cracks) across the screen of my 7th generation iPad. I phoned Apple Support and described the problem to the agent who answered the phone. He told me that since I bought the iPad in December 2019, the repair would be covered by an Apple warranty. I was then told that I would receive a box from Apple via FedEx, which would be used to ship the iPad to Apple for repair. Using the box that was supplied, I shipped the iPad to Apple on September 1. The repair ID for this transaction is D463437069 and the case number is 101170295110.On September 3, I received an email from Apple saying that its technicians had found a problem with my iPad that wasn’t mentioned in my phone conversation with Apple. I phoned Apple and was told that there was a crack in the iPad’s screen. Before the iPad was sent to Apple in the supplied box, there was not a visible crack in its screen. I am requesting that Apple provide me with documentation of the crack – the location of the crack on the screen, its dimensions and any other relevant information that would show that the crack was in existence when the iPad was in my possession. Since I needed my iPad back as soon as possible, I agreed to the repair. However, $249 is a high price to pay for an Apple product that is under warranty and was without a crack in its screen when I mailed it to Apple.I have owned several Apple products and have always been impressed by the company’s integrity. In fact, Apple has stated that: 1.	Apple conducts business ethically, honestly, and in full compliance with all laws and regulations. This applies to every business decision in every area of the company worldwide.2.	Apple's success is based on creating innovative, high-quality products and services and on demonstrating integrity in every business interaction. Apple's principles of business conduct define the way we do business worldwide…3.	[Apple demonstrates] honesty and high ethical standards in all business dealings.As CEO of Apple Inc., I ask that you provide me with the information that I have requested in the third paragraph of this letter. I am asking you to issue me a refund of $249 if your inquiry into this matter concludes that I was treated unfairly by Apple, Inc."
"I bought a MacBook Pro 15” 2017 in two years the computer shut down and stop working, $2500 computer for 2 years use what a rip-off. Of course no warranty and super expensive to repair. I’m definitely no longer buying or recommending Apple products."
"Ordered daughters phones for Christmas weeks ago now being told won’t be getting them till after Christmas but no date as yet poor service , ruined Christmas thanks apple"

"Money grabbing dishonest company. They care little for their customers and are terrible to try and work with. Furthermore they actively engage in convoluted ways to avoid paying tax sometimes at the customers own expense, as I found out. It amazes me the number of people who vilified Microsoft but are sycophants to Apple, who in my considered opinion are a significantly more immoral company."
"This is worst company I ever found in my entire life named 'apple'. Now a days they are actually a most fraudulent organization and always trying to impose their frauds to the customer like us.I ordered 06 times for a iPhone12 pro through apple store even by using apple card, and every time this dishonest people just cancelled my order by saying that your billing information is not correct, while the same time they approved a so called apple credit card by using the same address.Shame on apple, a big shame on apple. Worthless customer services in the world.Surajit Ray5832000195"
"Does anyone else make phones, like this great software and hardware is good too  only quibble is spare parts and fitting should be better priced."
"After buying an iphone for my grandson then realising there is no plug to charge it i am fuming to say the least and its not even a usb so u can use any plug, surely for the price u pay in the first place u should at least be able to charge it without making another purchase, i will never buy apple again and they should be disgusted with themselfs"
"It used to be a great company selling great products and with a great customer service. It isn't anymore, avoid it if you can.Bought an iPhone 12 Pro which came with some issue of overheating and battery draining really fast. I have been trying to get support since at least a month, but they have their stores closed and the support through the chat is the most useless thing ever. Really really frustrating."
"Apple mac book air! Apple has not made this computer worth the money you have to pay for it. I bought this brand new after having it 15 days computer broke! Camera stop working  then computer stop loading! It's not worth the money! Our mac book has been in repair for over 10 business days and still not repair. Don't buy this you will be waiting for months for repair! Never will I buy another apple product"
"***Do Not Buy Refurbished Apple Products***I bought a refurbished MacBook Air and found the all 12 of the function keys were not working.Upon spending hours on the phone to Apple Care it become apparent that it is a hardware problem.At this stage we were in week 2 of lockdown 2.0 were I am solely reliant on a laptop to be able to work and earn income.Apples solution was for me to return the laptop and wait up to 10 working days to get a replacement. This would mean and I am unable to work. I asked if it would be possible to Apple to drop off and collect where they would exchange the laptop for a replacement which was agreed. It was then apparent that there was no further laptop in stock and the only solution would be for me to upgrade and pay an additional £300 pounds to resolve what was Apple initial negligence in selling me a laptop with 12 defected keys. I agreed to this, and then at the 11th hour receive a call saying that this is not possible and that they cannot exchange the laptop for a different spec and can only offer me a refund.After countless calls back and forth Apples only solution is to offer me a refund, leaving me laptopless and unable to work.I am disgusted by how this has been dealt with, I’ve been passed around from person to person and made to feel like it’s my problem and that the only solution is to pay more to Apple.What a disappointment, I have used Apple for years. If only their customers service matched up to their products!"
"Apple's trade-in service, advertised on their website, is in reality dealt with by a third-party called Brightstar. I've used this service and Brightstar have misappropriated my property; however, Apple are refusing to assist. I also tried to raise the issue on Apple Support Communities but they won't publish my post. I was misled into using the trade-in service in the belief that it is managed by Apple, since it is advertised on Apple's website. In reality, Apple will do nothing to assist if any issues arise with the service advertised through their own website."
"Started complaining about how the mouse pointer became different, like a punch fist. Thought something was wrong about it. That was four years ago and nothing has changed since. Some time ago my macbook was locked out with firmware password, went to an authorized apple repair shop with my purchase note and email, yet apple office replied that verification was not possible. Very restrictive repair policy. In the end the macbook had to be unlocked with a third party."
"I need a new laptop. I haven’t bought one since 2012. I am shocked and disappointed at the price of the new MacBook Pro. It’s a choice between having to make do with a didly little 13” screen on which I can’t read anything. Can’t you at least make a bigger screen MacBook (not pro) for those of us that don’t need such high specs but need the screen size? I am also told that you can’t replace components in the same way as you could with the 2012 models. What’s this about Apple? Having said that I still love the ease in which everything Apple interacts."
"FrustratingApple use ti be great, great products great customer service.But now Apple is not what it used to be. Arrogant company with very poor customer service. It seems that they don't have any interest on solving any issue. The only answers you can get at apple is buy a new one or let me transfer you. Meaning we won't help you and I am tired of dealing with you. What a shame. The Romans and Greek empire are no more. Don't be so arrogant thinking that apple will be the the thing forerver."
"Literally the worst company you can have. Their systems are made to crash your phone, update your phone and expect the whole system to crash. None of my apps work, nothing is running correctly. I just upgraded my phone but when I updated my system to 14.2 everything keeps crashing, slowing down and not working. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!"
"On purpose slowing the devices so people have to buy new ones! Older phones lasted longer the newer ones are dearer and breaking quicker!"
"terrible company, terrible products, terrible customer service"
"Wayna was so understanding with me and my daughter Berkley. He spoke with me and was very patient and didnt rush me off the phone. We spoke about new technological advances, I consider him a valuable asset to Apple. Please recognize him as well as pay raise and increase in status. He has fresh ideas and fresh young pair of eyes. I can see why yall hired him. Thank you for making our night enjoyable we were able to resolve our issue as well and we arrived at the simplest. Thanks two hour headache turned into delight for my daughters bday today. That means alot to a single parent like me who stresses alot. Sincerely, Lauren E Kelley CEO LauBerk trademake made in USA."
"Too much pride from their product, anything happens it is always their customer’s fault! Arrogant people to deal with! Time to Move away from Apple! as there is no more innovation from their product while others already start introducing next gen products."
"Sorry Apple you can’t continue blaming Covid for subpar products and crappy customer service We have been a loyal Apple family with currently thousands of Apple products.Latest iPhone 2 months old battery and main mother board failed. Apples response ? Can’t see us in person despite all other business open with precautions in place Just mail it back and we will see about fixing multiple major issues and send back the same crap when we get around to it but hey don’t worry should get good now.Walmart has a better return policy than this and please having a senior supervisor reading from a script repeating “I understand” 500 times even asking to please stop repeating yourself so he could say 501 times I understand is disgusting.I use to overpay and said it was because of the great product and best of all the great customer service.Not anymore. What happened Apple? Too cocky now? Don’t care about your products or customers anymore?I’m over it I’ll be taking our 6 iPhones over to android and admitting my old argument of why I stayed so longer just doesn’t hold weight anymore."
"I wouldn't even give them a star. This has been the worst customer experience I have ever gone through. My old company has my old phone. I am trying to reset my Apple ID password to take control of my account. Every customer service rep sends me to same place then passes me to another customer service rep only to restart the process which never solves the problem. They then tell me they will contact me both by phone and email for recovery process and a month has gone by with no contact. If competitors had comparable products, I would have left them."
"Dont. support. apple. they are the worst. rude, arrogant, snobby, careless and unhelpful people in every way possible"
"Arrogant customer service. Issue of missing delivery not resolved after several attempts. Just pushed around and cut off by chat bots. Tim Cook sucks."
"Contacted Apple support as I hadn’t been able to activate my free one year of Apple TV and obviously had trouble getting through. I spoke to them twice and was kept on the line over an hour and a half to eventually told I couldn’t have it. Due to all the delays getting through the date had passed!  My question is why keep me hanging on the phone for nearly two hours to tell me this?  They are rubbish."
"The worst customer service I have ever had. Apple are dreadful. They arranged for my mac to be collected and repaid.  This has taken 5 weeks already. The laptop is in a foreigner language. The track pad and the key pad still do not work after sending the lap top back to apple.  Every time you call apple to put you on hold.I believe this do this so you get get feb up of waiting and hang up the phone. This lap top is only 4 years ago and still covered under Consumer Law so they should repair it. I can be contacted apple should you so wish to certify this review.NIGEL DALE"
"I have had a macbook air for 7 years. It still works perfectly, just a weakness regarding the battery but this is completely normal. I have also owned several iPhones. I have always loved Apple products. One star less because the products are expensive."
"Ordered iPhone 12 pro max came a week early difficulty getting tracking information on website but managed in the end. Overall a very nice phone and quick service."
"My iPhone 7 suddenly stopped working last week. Completely dead. It had not been dropped or damaged in anyway. I concluded it must be a problem with the battery. I had seen in the news that there were court cases against Apple for their poor quality batteries. I rang customer care to try and resolve the problem. Anyway after several calls and 3 hours on the phone they agreed to take the phone in and examine its battery etc. They wanted to charge me nearly £300. I refused to pay that amount so they charged me £58 which is the cost for a new battery. Today they have come back and said the phone has a hardware fault. And now they want £286 plus vat to fix it. Yes it’s a hardware fault I agree. It’s their rotten, useless battery that’s at fault. What a rip off. Once again a big corporate can screw over the consumer. They did get fined a piddling £100 mil or so. That nothing to them. Absolute cowboys."
"The worse experience ever. Trying to have replaced my broken phone with my apple care plan. I have tried 5 times now and no result. Very incompetente people"
"Absolutely impossible to reach an actual human with apple support. Won’t let you update to use apps you have and absolutely no way to contact a living human. Complete disgrace. Total garage support for such a huge company"
"Hi, Everyone I just wanted to let you know how bad my Apple iPhone SE2 is . I can honestly say after having iPhones for years that this is the biggest piece of rubbish I’ve ever had . I should of stuck with my 6s . It constantly freezes, drops WiFi, and has rubbish reception on 4g ."
"Apple at South Hills Village location in Pennsylvania gets an F"
"Their products are superior to anyone else's, that can't be argued... I recently broke my iPhone 7 for good, and couldn't afford a new iPhone, so had to get a sh**ty Android.. well, how I miss my iPhone. Their customer service is also exceptional - better than any other company I've ever experienced, in fact! They are very caring, make it personal, stick with you until your problem has been resolved, and they're always extremely patient - never getting frustrated, just super friendly people. Cannot rate that highly enough; I LOVE their customer service!What I hate, however, is the fact the price of their products have sky-rocketed.. meaning I can now no longer justify buying them. Boo."
"Customer service behind the plastic goon shields were mask shaming us into submission like communist china. Apple Customer service are liberal lazy kids that are under trained and have no clue what customer service is. Apple sucks transferring to any anti communist phone company. Law suits for Mask shaming coming!!"
"Short and simple .How on earth can it be possible to buy a £1300 phone ( inclusive of apple care )And it not come  with a charger ??I do have an old plug adapter but the new cable doesn’t fit ?Absolute shocking especially in the middle of the pandemic !"
"Macbook pro 15 inches 2016/17 suffer from poor quality cable to screen which wears and leads to stagelight  effect and eventual blank screen. For some reason, Apple are only replacing on 13 inch versions, leaving those with a 15inch with a huge bill as screen has to be replaced."
"excellent on solving my problem excellent service and product"
"I bought my ipad pro (12.9inch, 3rd Gen Wi-Fi) in August 2019. It began continuously re-booting itself in September 2020, which I assumed was a software issue. After some unsuccessful attempts to rectify the issue, Apple support advised me to do a factory reset. This was unsuccessful, and rendered the ipad useless, as the software had been wiped, and would not reinstall. I sent the ipad to Apple for repair, which they told me would be free for a software fault, and they have now informed me the ipad has been bent (via accidental damage) and will cost £515 + VAT to repair. (They have since informed me it cannot be repaired and a replacement would be sent, for the same charge). My ipad has always had a slight curve to it, which has probably got worse over time, but I always kept it in a case and thought nothing of it. It is certainly not accidental damage, as I have never mistreated it. Having researched this topic on the internet, I now see that curved/bent ipad pros are a REALLY common issue - with many shipping from the factory already bent. I feel like I have been sold a £1200 product with a manufacturing defect, and have been falsely accused of accidentally damaging it. I wouldn't recommend buying an Apple ipad to anyone."
"Getting service at an Apple Store in Colorado Springs is a real trick.  You cannot call the store.  Asking for a store manager and you will wait 30 minutes or more. I did.  What a farce.  When you call the store it transfers you to Apple support not the store and when you can get to the store you are put on hold and when you can get the manager they are unable to help.  I used to have this unusual respect for Apple but Apple support has changed all that.  Apple is no better than Consumer Cellular. Poor."
"Can I give you less than 1 star!?. You buy a company’s product, multiple products, and God forbid you expect them to work as they describe and advertised. A watch, AirPods and phone. How many hard earned dollars were spent? Only to spend hours every damn day wondering why they aren’t connected, or pairing. Or why NO ONE can hear or understand me. Why I end up quickly disconnecting from everything to hold it to my ear or find the speaker phone function. Why I feel taken advantage of everyone I put this piece of garbage watch on. And how much I wanna punch someone every time I hear the Siri speak. “Working on it”. “I can’t do that now”. “Please try again later”. I can’t wait to toss this hunk of junk off a 2 foot wall and watch is shatter and become unusable. Garbage. I wouldn’t buy another to wipe my ass with."
"Apple allows fraudulent activity to be charged to your credit card if you have one on file then say you are not eligible for a refund. Apple customer service is one of the worst I have ever dealt with. Apple products are overrated and overpriced not worth the money. Will never buy another Apple product not worth it"
"Good products and whilst AppleCare and products can be expensive, it's no secret. customer service can be frustrating and slow which is my qualm"
"APPLE Products: iPhone (all models I’ve had since iPhone 4!), iPad Pro, Apple Watch (currently series 5)All suffer repeated issues that Apple are aware of of but don’t care about! Repeated requests for email account password; issue persisting after MONTHS of this and several ‘fixes’ followed!Repeated crashes following the release ONLY of new IOS updates; funny how my device is OK UNTIL these clowns release a new software version! This cant be a coincidence after YEARS!!No control over basic functions like stopping/restricting alerts on one device vs the next! I paid for this crap Apple so why cant I have control of which device does or does not get a text alert etc??? Repeated and ongoing missed alert issues with iPhone randomly silencing itself; speak to Apple and its always the users fault even though their ‘fixes’ cant fix it!APPLE: BASICALLY A LIVING VERSION OF THE STORY ‘The Emperors New Clothes’ with their laughable ‘product development/evolution’! The iPhone 12 amazing BLATANT cheap rate copy of the iPhone 4! Apples logo/motto should be ‘apple, we’ll fix it until its broken!’Also why is this company allowed to cleanse the internet of anything that doesn’t kiss their.... ???"
"I ordered an iPhone XR that showed on my email as “ delivered “but i did not receive it !! Call customer “care” they told me  looks like UPS has this marked as delivered and there’s nothing we can do about it,no investigation, no refund or replacement, so basically i paid for a phone that someone else is gonna be using !"

"iPhone XS sucks at being water resistant. My iPhone XS mistakenly got soaked by tap water while brushing and now the screen went black before I could turn it off. I can still hear sounds but can't see anything. I wiped it off immediately and dried it, yet my phone is water damaged (my phone is not cracked by the way). I am so pissed because on the apple website AND while I was sold the phone, I was told it could withstand being submerged in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes, yet it crashed under TAP WATER in like 10 secs???  And to check my apple warranty, it does not cover water damage loooool. A phone that focuses on water resistance as a marketing strategy does not have warranty on water damage???  It's you guys being so calculative for me. Then I check apple repair online and it's around 650 -799 dollars for water damage Loooool. That's a whole new phone. As a student that is rent, and if I go somewhere cheaper my warranty is void loool.  Got to give it to the company's business strategist. At least bait your customers with features that actually function. Do not market WATER RESISTANCE and make your customers believe their phone will be fine when it comes in contact with a little water."
"I have decades of IT work.  I moved from PCs to Apple because of the constant GPF and malware and virus issues.  12 years ago, Apple support had a reputation that they spoke English and were good.  That's false - but they speak English.  I get enough from support to figure things out on my own but I've watched support destroy novices with wrong guidance.I've had systems completely ruined because support  didn't know what they were doing.  They have gotten so bad that I'm trashing Apple when these computers die (one will soon and if the recent Mac isn't repaired by those that destroyed it - apple support 3rd party, it's getting trashed).Let Apple die.  iPhones are horrible and expensive and computers are way overpriced."
"Apple online store is the worst experience ever! They do ads about a fast shipping process and they are by faarr the worst and slowest shipping! I pre ordered the iphone 12 max pro on the 6th of November, and until today, 23 november, the status is still Processing!! We bought the same phone for my sister from another platform, and arrived in less than 2 days. The customer service are useless and no one can interfere to accelerate the process. Shame"
"I ordered 2 iPhones 12 pro max on November 6. A couple of days ago Apple authorized the withdraw of an amount corresponding to one of the 2 phones only, then, they tried mistakenly to authorize an amount much higher than the remaining due amount (declined due to insufficient funds.) I called them many times (apple customer care do not work on weekends in some countries!!) The first time I reached them, hey opened a case and promised will be taken care in one business day. The second time I called, the operator said that the accounting team replied that the system will mistakenly continue the attempt of withdrawing the wrong amount; while holding the amount of one device, the system will try to charge the full 2 devices amount throughout a week, after that the order will be cancelled!!! They can do nothing about it, and I have to wait 7 days to get a reply from a customer care supervisor. I felt that the operator was very happy to cancel the order when I proposed so; the condition for me to cancel my order was to receive an email with the transcript of our full discussion to reserve my rights. Apple were trying to show that these mistakes are easy and normal ones, there are similar cases, they are not prompt to solve similar cases quickly, and they are ready to get rid of a problem by getting rid of the customer."
"The screen for my i-Phone SE 2nd generation that was still on warranty went black. It would not register touches from my finger nor did it light up. However, I was able to login using touch ID and even take a picture with the side button and home button held down, so it was obvious that the screen was defective. This was from no physical damage - no dropping, no water damage, no damage from an electrical circuit etc. One second it was working fine, then the next, it went black.The earliest they were able to get a new phone to me was 3 - 5 days. However, I run my business from my i-Phone and needed a replacement immediately. During the replacement process, an Apple senior support specialist named Ben from Apple Support Ticket ID 101245636285 told me to erase my phone on the find my iphone website. At no point did he tell me that this was going to erase my phone's data. This raised a red flag for me, so I asked him if I should erase. I thought this was just removing the phone from the find my iphone network and might not erase my data. He responded by telling me to just click erase the phone, so I did. I hold Apple responsible for this loss of data, however, when I informed them later what happened, they were not able to offer anything for my losses.Again, I run my business from my i-phone, and neither Apple nor T-mobile would offer me an immediate replacement, so I paid over $450 for a replacement iphone SE 2nd generation.This is terrible customer service on both T-mobile and Apple's side to not offer an immediate replacement for a defective phone. One of these parties needs to be held responsible. Additionally, Apple representatives need training to always ask and inform the customer when data is being deleted."
"I ordered my ipad pro on nov 1st,2020 and today is nov 22. they have not shipped it yet and it is still under processing. It is too bad , i wanted to gift it to some one and i am still waiting for it to be shipped. If you dont have the product available, apple should inform us  first while confirming the order"
"If you want to buy something from the online refurbished store, beware.I recently purchased a refurbished iPhone thru the online store via PayPal. The same day I purchased was notified that item shipped and was on its way. When the box arrived, there was a clear plastic InCase cover for a 13"" MacBook Air inside. No phone. I chatted online with a service specialist and was told the only option I had was to return the product to Apple. Once it was returned and in their system, it would take up to 5 business days to get my money refunded to my PayPal account.I didn't want a refund. I wanted what I bought from them and they told me they sent me. I just wanted them to send me another phone like the one I purchased and they can keep the money.The next day I looked on the refurbished store website and they still had phones like I purchased for sale. I called and talked to another specialist via phone. They apologized profusely, admitted the problem was theirs, but absolutely under no circumstances send me a different phone, unless I did a repurchase on a new order, investing even more of my money with them, with no assurance that the same thing or something even MORE bizarre would not happen again.I would expect something like this from a fly-by-night operation out of Podunk. Apple is supposed to be this tech-savvy cool company. Have purchased other items from the refurbished store before with no problems.Still waiting for my money. 8 days now. What a shame.I had to select one star to post this review. They don't deserve any."
"Hey apple, I would like to spell a word and not get autocorrected as if I’m an incapable dumbass thats not able to spell my own words you f*cktards. If I spell a word correctly I don’t need you fuckfaces to correct my grammar if the word I spelled is spelled correctly."
"Background: I purchased a pair of limited edition Studio3 Beats in porcelain rose from Cribbs Causeway Apple store Feb 2018. Unfortunately a couple of weeks ago the folding mechanism broke. I spoke to one of their advisors who advised that I was outside of my warranty period, but for £200 I would receive another pair of beats in the same colour porcelain rose. What has happened so far: I was sent a replacement pair of studio 3 beats in white. This was a shock to me, as I did not and would not buy a pair in white, or a pair that was not limited edition. At no point did any of the advisors suggest that this might be the outcome from this warranty exchange. I called the customer services to understand what was going on, and I was told a number of different stories. - Yes they are in stock in Porcelain Rose and we can replace them- No they are not in stock, but we will see what we can do to replace them. - Yes you can have the white ones collected and get a refund- No you have to keep the white ones, and we cant give you a refund- We could swap the white ones for black ones- When you return yours there was no guarantee that you would get porcelain rose- When you return your beats you only get the option of white or black and it is pot luckAs you can see the messaging of what options there are has been really confusing. I have been on the phone to many different agents for around 3+hrs over the last 24 hrs discussing all of these options. Where I am now: Apple are refusing to refund, or provide any alternatives, and so I am left with a pair of headphones I did not order without any packaging to enable me sell on.  I am so disappointed with this service. I have many apple products and am a loyal customer, and this seems completely off."
"My daughter uses Duolingo and accidentally purchased a years subscription to the service at £78. This left me with nothing in my account. I raised the issue with them and explained the situation, I have been issued a full refund within 24hrs and am so grateful. Great service *****"
"Visited Apple Carindale Store today with a 3 year old Apple SE. Despite being well treated, this phone had a total internal failure and required replacement ( confirmed in writing by Apple Mac Service at University of Queensland).Spoke to store manager and requested a discount on a new SE phone as replacement. Due to being outside Apple warranty, no help was offered. Quote ""Total failure is not unusual"" despite being told the opposite by Apple Service. Sadly had to part with full retail price for a new phone, as Apple Australia are not prepared to stand behind thier product outside of stated warranty. Just hope thst this new phone doesn't share the same fate!"
"Customer support is filled with uneducated, terrible people, it is not worth getting a product straight from apple because they have the worst shipping services. They never contact you when your product arrives and send it back to apple without telling you and tell you to wait fanother 3-4 weeks to get your product. I still havent received my product. NEVER BUY STRAIGHT FROM APPLE, you dont get anywhere from their customer support team, because they do nothing and tell you the wrong things, the whole thing is unbelievably frustrating."
"Michael from online customer support was AMAZING"
"My iPad suddenly die and I can’t even go to store to check due to COVID-19. I called apple and they arrange a parcel collection and ask my credit card detail. I said I do not want to set up repair now without knowing the issue. The guy said they won’t take payment but just need it to set up the parcel and they will call me before they do anything on my iPad but they didn’t. They just go ahead the repair and took money from card. I called them to stop the payment but they refused. Such pain and unfair!!"
"They are terrible at customer service. They leave you waiting on the phone for how many hours. Transfers your call to the wrong people. I’m just so disgusted. They don’t know what the problem is they can’t fix nothing. Ew just over it."
"So I have the latest ipad. I also have the latest apple pencil. Are they compatible? No. What a joke. Absolute scammers. You release an affordable ipad yet you force people to buy the ipad air (double the cost) just so the apple pencil will work? Unfair and elitist should be this company's motto."
"RIP Steve Jobs. Since you left, Apple think doing away with the headphone jack on phones is a great idea. Forced updates every few weeks change the interface on apps without your permission. Constant harassment with 'reminders' if you don't use biometric sign-in.I'm not your robot, child, dog or prisoner, Apple. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER GOING TO TOUCH YOUR GARBAGE AGAIN. GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO PUSH AROUND"
"I will never buy apple product again and will not advice anybody to purchase their product.here is what they sayHi Musa,Thanks for choosing Apple Support for your repair request.Repair ID D470030123 was created for serial number C02W32AUHV29.

"support is very bad, its not possible to cancel a order online, and I had to wait in the service line for 40 minutes"
"Absolute s*it show. I can't access my IPhone because my apple id is blocked. first for 7 now for 13 DAYS. LIKE WHAT? AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS??? AND WANT ME TO WAIT 13 DAYS WITHOUT A PHONE? EXCUSE ME? Excuse my language but f* this."
"Refuse to acknowledge or fix broken apple devices.  They have a repair partner in the Czech Republic they use who cant do their job properly and refuse to fix devices.Apple fails in a few areas. Refurbished devices, repairs and support and also devices having random bugs and lack of quality control in some/many devices.Devices which are refurbs were previously defective and the same issue can recur for the new owner creating an iphone shaped tin of worms"
"scammers xoxo"
"I just bought my daughter the iPhone xr and it doesn't even come with the charging block. So it's not enough to spend a lot of money on apple's product but in order to use it you must then go spend $50 buying the charging block. Greed is a terrible thing."
"I have numerous appleProducts fromComputers, iPad, laptop and 6 phones on the account. I appreciate the Covid restrictions. I am simply trying to get in to a store in Honolulu Hawaii to purchase a new iPhone and wanted to compare the iPhone versus the iPhone Pro/12 series. We’re trying to schedule an appointment. No appointments are available online. We actually visited both stores that were close by, went to the store, to be told that there were no appointments available only to look inside the store to see one single customer with at least six people (employees) working in the store. Actually standing there doing nothing. We are simply trying to purchase yet another Apple product and even calling the customer service line were told that we cannot have an appointment. Seriously thinking about actually trying an android phone because the customer service could not be any worse than Apple at this point .How about customer service, wanting to sell your new product, and keeping customers who have been life long customers? Just curious."
"Last night while my mom was using her phone, it overheated and the battery exploded, splitting the phone and exposing the interior. My mom was very upset when this happen as it was a clear safety hazard and it was something we had never experienced from Apple products. We googled whether this is safe, and the results stated that this is not safe, due to the chemicals in the battery being toxic and flammable. Which is ironic, as the report Apple gave us stated they had to replace the display, due to chemical damage from the battery leaking onto the display. I wouldn't want to know what could happen.We took the phone in today to let Apple know that this happened and that we were upset. They said we had to pay for a new battery. Which my mom reluctantly accepted, as all her photos and data were in the phone and she didn't want to loose them.When we picked up the phone and asked for a report on why the battery exploded and whether this was safe, as well as why we had to pay for the replacement, the employee was unsure. Fair as this didn't appear to be a common occurrence or anything the employee had experienced. My mom asked to speak to the manager, as she may have more insight and and could hear our concerns. She was very rude and disrespectful, in regard to my mom being upset and concerned about her safety. When my mom stated that she did not feel safe with having a phone that could explode and asked whether she should turn off the phone before she goes to bed, the manager replied ""sure, do whatever makes you feel safe"", as if an exploded phone was not shocking. When my mom asked why we had to pay for the replacement when this was an issue that was out of our hands, the manager replied, ""It's just like the warranty on a car. If you don't have warranty then you have to pay."". Additionally, while my mom was visibly upset and had begun to talk over the manager, the manager rudely replied, ""It's my turn to talk"".A few points. This phone is a safety hazard. The battery was leaking. This is not your regular warranty situation as it is not regular wear and tear related. My mom didn't crack her screen and was looking for quick fix. We're not adding to the millions of reduced battery life complaints (however that was present). And lastly, this is not something which we as customers made happen due to our negligence. This is an appliance, provided by Apple, which is faulty and is a safety hazard. As customers, we shouldn't have to be penalized for Apple's faulty products."
"I went to the apple store to get my phone checked out because it has been giving me a lot of problems for almost 3 weeks now. I have contacted my phone service and went through every technical support they asked me to due. I factory reset my phone like they told me to, i even did a network reset and that still did not help. The tech that i spoke with over the phone told me to bring my phone to the apple store so they can look at it. All that was done was a restore which i have done 3 times prior to calling tech support. When i asked well what if this doesn't work his response was you will just have to buy a new phone. For one I am already making payments on my current phone which is the iPhone xs max.. My phone is not cracked nor water damage but apple will not help and the kicker is he told me to pay 338 to upgrade early for a new iPhone like what! why would i do that when my current phone is giving me issues and you all are not trying to help fix it. Very Bad customer service"
"I went into Apple this morning because my iphone screen stopped working, and I have a macbook Air less than 1yr of purchase that has a bad charging port with some faulty connections. Since I could not call anyone on my phone, I went into Apple. I had 3 employees walk by the store glass, did not acknowledge me, and I finally had to wave down someone. An apple employee and a mall security guard walked up to me about my issue. They told me I had to call AppleCare. I told them my phone is NOT working for the second time. How am I supposed to call? Then they proceeded to tell me to get a hold of a friends phone. My friends live 45min or more away, I have no phone to call them on, and I need service. I asked if they could schedule me for an appointment at the store like they usually would and said they had limited services and could not help me. I left helpless, drove to an outside source to hopefully get my phone fixed. Then spent 1hr on the phone with AppleCare after my phone got fixed just to have them tell me that I needed to go into a store for service..... This took 4.5hrs to get resolved instead of Apple scheduling me in the first place. Very bad customer service."
"I got 4 cell phones and Three brand new MacBook pro 2 13inch and one 16 inch laptops.  On saturday I came to the store with five thousand dollars  I wanted to buy a desktop IMAC pro for $4500. Jacob the tech was very nice to me extremally respectful However when the phone brought to me by another guy....that tech was very rood. because of the way I was treated at that store by your tech who came to collect the $49 for the battery for my phone who lost my protective cover and accused me for stilling I will never step my foot in your store again or buy any of your product again. Apple should be ashamed for hiring such people this is the worse store in Colorado. With a tore rotator calf and elbow I had to beg them to let me in because of the cold.  They should be ashamed of themselves how they treed costumers."
"Awful apple customer service was on the phone for I don't know how long to have my issue not resolved. I was sent a charger last week, can't trace, can't know where is it. I just have to wait. Is incredible how you can pay for a device £1200 and get customer service so below average. Plus let's talk about the new iPhone? No charger no earphones? incredible"
"Went through 3 brand new macbooks over 4 months all faulty out of the box and apple didn't give a flying s**t. My company card has also been charged €250 for an order never placed and I've been chasing this up for over a month. Once again apple doesn't care"
"Travelled 114 miles to pickup an iPhone .Manufacturing defect in phone. Dust particles trapped inside rear glass. Apple support has no replacement offer available. Suggested to try in stores of replacement."
"I was on my phone and my phone got stuck on a picture of yaoi and it wont die and wont turn off so i tried all the methods and they dont work this sucks"

"Hey, bought a $2K+ laptop from Apple in May.  FedEx never delivered it.  Reported it to Apple for investigation.  Was supposed to take 5 days.  Took 10 days which was blamed on pandemic and holiday.  Then Apple billed me for a undelivered laptop!  Had to endure drama to get that sorted out.  Was offered a ""Good Will Gesture"" accessory for all my troubles and delays.  Contacted Apple twice about the accessory that to this day never came.  Contacted Apple again about it and they said that I was not eligible for ""Good Will Gesture.""  As if it was initiated by us!  ""F"" Apple!  They cannot be trusted.  They take advantage of female customers by using bullying tactics to get out of following through on their initiated promises.  They are shameful, disgraceful; they suck!!  We all should boycott Apple, until someone learns how to treat the very customers that have mistaken contributed to their position in the market.  They need to learn they have to deserve our business, not deserve to go through the BS we have to endure to receive their products!!"
"too disappointed with Apple service, got my iPad Pro for 2 years, Bring to the store they cannot fix It and ask me to buy a new one!!! One thousand dollars for 2 years on a device they can’t fix it. I call customer support they ask me to wait for Black Friday to shop for cheaper price. What kind Apple service it’s this???"
"Apple is the worst.. I have to wait 24 hours than another 27 days to reset my password.... I don’t get it"
"I love apple but in ios 15 they should make it possible to change the colors of your messages in Imessage. Like how instagram has it they should allow you to do it like that."
"Update from Catalina to big sur a big mistake!  Laptop no longer working so have had to wipe and start again.Not good enough apple I’ll take my money elsewhere"
"Appalling, frustrating and extremely poor customer service. Up dated from Catalina to Bir Sur as recommended by Apple on a constant basis. MacBook Pro 2017 crashed. WiFi not working (unable to turn on). Half updated and overheating, fan contantanly on so to cool and battery running out really fast. Speaking to customer services for 90 mins who are based in the Philippines. This poor poor guy just didn't have a clue, he put me on hold 3x 10 min time to check out the basics of problems with his Supervisor. In between long pauses when I did have him on phone it give me time to reflect on all the issues myself, wife and kids were having with Apple over the years. I have easily spent 15k on Apple products over the last 5-6 yrs and taught about the return I got for that investment. Not good but perhaps it a ""God Send"". I have officially announced as from today 16/11/2020 that I do synonym swear that no Apple products shall enter my household going forth. My hard earned money shall buy another mana facture at a massive decreased price and I shall live happily ever after. Shame on you Apple you have got too big for you boots. Treating loyal customers like dirt. The word is out."
"My wife’s iPhone was working perfectly before she ran the latest software update and it then entered a bootloop which I have been unable to recover it. Spent hours trying to get any support from Apple which achieved sweet fanny adams! Just had to order a new phone from Apple to get my wife running again. What a brilliant marketing experience, render your phone inoperable so you have to buy a new one. Looking online she’s not the only person that has experienced the same problem. Shameful"
"Disappointed with Apple service lately. I have just been on the phone for nearly an hour with a mouse issue and hadn't even got past the clueless first 'advisor'. I seem to remember getting through to actual experts? The nail in the coffin was when she called back (after I had told her I couldn't spend any more time on this issue today and said goodbye) and told me the call was being recorded, whereupon I told her I would record it too and she said that wasn't allowed. You what now?"
"very unhappy with my phone as had no charger and not given one separatecustomer service was good but still disappointed"
"I have made a purchase of iphone 12 pro. They deducted the amount. I went there to collect. They said your order was cancelled. I did not cancel the order. I did not receive any email confirming order cancellation. I travelled to collect my phone in lockdown. Website said money is not deducted. My card shows money was deducted. When i called the customer support it directed me to automated support probably a bot. It did not help me with my query. When i called again the customer support they kept me on hold like forever. So in all, I make a purchase, i do not cancel the order, i do not receive any cancellation communication, my money is not available with me to spend till cleared, i travel all the way to collect, i chase Apple support and i write the feedback. What did Apple do? We are sorry for inconvenience, they said."
"I think it’s utterly ridiculous that you remove my iCloud email address just because I don’t purchase your iCloud storage. I have been backing up to iTunes forever and now all of a sudden you are forcing me to pay for iCloud. This company just got too greedy for me and when my phone is up, I will be going to android. I also have an iMac and an iPad that will need to be updated. Windows computer and android tablet here I come."
"Very poor customer support when a €1300 iPad Pro stopped working after only 3 years, would not repair and suggested a replacement for €600. Reminded them of EU consumer laws and they believe it doesn’t apply to them.. consumer lawsuit pending."
"Excellent service in Boca Raton Christian I visited the Boca Apple Store during my lunch at a very busy time to take care of issues with my new iPhone!My phone had some factory damage, I didn’t have chance to change my phone because of pandemic. All stores were closed so I had to wait.Christian in Apple support at  Boca Raton mall helped me and was excellent!!!! Im not sure if he was the seller or the technician, but he was wonderful. He helped me resolve my iPhone issues. When I recognized that I didn’t have my mom’s pictures as they seemed deleted.I went back to this store, and really didn’t think I had a chance to bring back my moms pictures. I thought they were lost.He was a  really nice and patient person. He was able to get back my old phone so that I could finish my back up.Today I have my phone with my mom pictures that very important to me.Christian not sure I am spelling his name correct)Was very determined, professional and nice.He wasn’t like robot and cared about helping me!!!!"
"Shame on you Apple! Trying to nickel and dime your customers by making us pay for a charging block for the new iPhone! I bought the new iPhone 12 Pro max and I paid $1399 (plus tax) for this and it doesn’t come with headphones OR a charging block?!? Come on guys. That’s ridiculous! First no headphones on the last model, now this! Now this model has no headphones  OR charging block?!?Now you gotta purchase it as a extra?! Excuse me, but why should we pay over $1300 for an iPhone and have to pay extra for a charging block?! Absolutely disgusted  with you guys. Steve Jobs is probably rolling over in his grace, I’m sure this isn’t the Apple he envisioned. Shame on you! 🤬😡"
"Mrs.Davis, I can’t remember her first name. But Mrs. Davis was amazing and helped me so much. I hope she might possibly see this to know that I did find my AirPods that she was helping me look for. Again she was one of the absolute best customer service representatives I’ve ever spoke to and I have to say I was completely satisfied with my experience as I always am with Apple."
"I had a phone water damaged beyond repair. Only solution to buy a new one. Problem,to activate new one and keep data. Very difficult, impossible for me. Contacted Apple support, got Don who was amazing; totally focussed, knowledgable, dedicated, extremely patient and he did it!!! Despite all dead ends he persevered and succeeded, I now have a fully operative phone."
"Shame on them for nickel and dimming customers by now not sending a charging block with the new iPhone 12!!! Now you gotta purchase it as a extra?! Excuse me but I pay over 1000 dollars for my iPhone why should I have to pay extra for a charging block?! Absolutely discussed with them"
"Unfortunately the general experience with Apple has been absolutely terrible and I surely will not be ordering a product directly from the online store. If i could select a minus option i would surely do so. For such a huge organisation who are very quick to take so much money for their products the customer journey is rubbish. I recently purchased the iphone 12 mini and later decided i want to return it. The return or cancel option is non-existent via the app store which i was continuously referred to. This therefore resulted in me having to call only to be put on hold for a long time and then be automatically cut off. After nearly a week of trying, i managed to get through only to be passed from one department to another with the end result being automatically disconnected. All i wanted was a simple return label or for a return process to be started which seems to be a new experience for Apple. It has genuinely been the most exhausting and frustrating experience. They really need to invest some money into a hassle free return journey where we are not going around like headless chickens."
"Do not buy a MacBook. It is the worst laptop I have ever seen. It just deleted my applications for no reason. Trying to use coding languages on this piece of garbage is ridiculously hard with all of the downloads and differences from windows do not buy."
"Last week I had to bring my Macbook Air in for repair, as the battery started playing up. I was able to make an appointment with a Genius bar over the phone (lady on the phone was helpful, hence the 1st star). When I got to the Apple store in London it was chaotic. It looked like there were 3 different queues going on, clearly people all desperate to get their devices fixed before the second lockdown. Not surprisingly, I queued up for a good 30 minutes. When I finally got in, the 'Genius' told me the battery had failed ''cause I leave it plugged in when it's not being used''. That was the only advice I got. I said I hardly do, but according to him that was it. The Macbook is just over 2 years old, with a cycle count at 46...? And the battery fails and it's my fault..? I was trying to ask about consumer law as well but apparently batteries never fall under that.. So I had to fork out £129 to replace the battery. The only good thing was that they had it replaced within a few hours, hence the second star. Other than that, the 'Genius' guy offered hardly any advice, I felt like I wasn't really listened to and having been out of a job for nearly 6 months I really could have done with a bit more help, especially bearing in mind they make MILLIONS. Disappointing customer service for such a recognised brand. I have always had Windows laptops before and never had any issues! The first time I bought a Mac may well be my last."
"It really does beggar belief how this company has become so successful. The arrogance displayed and downright contempt they have for customers is shocking.My I_Phone 8 is playing up and I really wonder if they have put something into the upgrade that makes this happen, coincidentally there is a new I-Phone 12 out.I won't be buying and once this garbage I have bought.I-Mac - £3500 worthI_Pad - £800 worthI-Phone - £600 worth reaches end of it's life I will be burning it.Organised Criminals are more honest than this lot.And the fact they hide billions $$ Ofshore tells you so much about the leadership ... it's one big FRAUD."
"I had amazing experience with John very friendly experience person.I really appreciate thank you John you are star"
"I sent an Apple Mac to be repaired which had a faulty screen which was only 5 months old, I then got an email from them saying the screen was cracked and it was my fault, they wanted me to pay £473.50 + Tax. I had a photo of the computer before I sent it, clearly showing it wasn’t cracked. After 3 hours on the phone with several different advisors. They are sending me the computer back unfixed and in worse condition now than when I sent it to them. The advisor on the phone actually said to me, that I was not his friend when things got a bit heated. Absolutely disgusting customer service which I was surprised about, I would never recommend Apple to anyone. James Oatley"
"Update: I was having issues with my MacBook Pro updating. I finally got it updated, but Apple support was no help at all. I’ve also been having other issues. Apple has an issue right now where all of my devices keep having memory usage being filled in what they call the “Other” category. It’s to the point that I can’t update my devices because the “Other” category is using up almost all of the memory on my devices. Even if I delete all apps, photos, files, etc. On my devices there is still not enough storage. I’ve chatted with Apple support a number of times and the ONLY way to fix they can give me is to do a full restart wiping ALL memory. Which is VERY frustrating and time consuming. I just have to keep using my Apple devices watching the “Other” category slowly taking up more and more memory until I need to do another restart wiping all of the memory from my devices and then set up the device again starting the whole process over. Apple has NO fix for this and the feeling I get is that this is planned obsolescence by Apple so customers will see their devices with no memory and many customers will find it easier to just buy the latest devices rather than spend time wiping the memory and restarting the device from scratch. I’m sure this is great for more business in the short term to get people buying new devices, but I no longer recommend Apple to others like I used to. I’m on the search for better devices.Original Review: Apple used to have good customer service. I’m not sure what happened, but now it takes forever to schedule an appointment at an Apple store. Then you still need to wait for help even with an appointment. Then the “Geniuses” at the Apple store seem to be mildly trained employees that take forever to figure out what the issue is. Today (11/12/20) my Mac won’t update, and Apple removed the chat option from customer service on their website, so if I want to get help, then they make you call them and wait on hold until someone is available to pick up the call. This is SO disappointing. They don’t even have an option to leave your phone number to call you when they’re ready, so you don’t need to wait on your phone for hours."
"Shocking trying to claim for a 2 year old device under cusumer law. 4 hours later they finally turn around and say the device hasn't failed because of a manufacturing defect literally because they don't want to help. Any excuse. It should be noted Apple may be a well polished company but their customer care after purchase is appalling."
"Horrible horrible horrible! This has got to be a joke? Yes? On the phone today for over 4 hrs! Yes, I said 4, FOUR HOURS!! Still on hold as Im writing this review!! They are in ept and have no idea how they are a successful company!  This is outrageous"
"I am almost heartbroken considering how loyal of an Apple customer I have been for decades. I am a designer and apple is used in every job and every home application I have ever had. I now have a family with two young children and I have been having a lot of issues with the parental controls and family sharing. These issues are costly and dangerous as the settings for location content and billing are all affected by the technical problems. We paid arms and legs for Apple care support and every person in my family owns multiple Apple devices. However the support has been completely ineffective. We’ve already been escalated to senior advisers and I’ve spoken to multiple senior advisers and they all assured me that they are going to help me and then either drop off the face of the earth or completely ineffectively try to address my problem with ridiculous and basic solutions. Finally they have escalated the problem to engineering however the engineers ask for one task or one setting to be changed per week or month essentially getting us nowhere. Meanwhile my children’s privacy and use of their devices, during a pandemic when we are dependent on these - is compromised. We have not been able to speak to engineering directly it’s always through messenger which takes a lot of time and if you don’t happen to be available right when they call you’re essentially dropped. I have a full time job and 2 children to care for.The amount of time that I have spent trying to speak with and deal with this issue with multiple advisers is unacceptable. It has been months and my issue has not been resolved or even addressed in a complete manner. This is really the worst technical support experience I’ve ever had with any company and I expect more from Apple. Products and support service are so expensive. Then to have problems that affect your family safety and your accounts and not even be able to actually address these issues with tech-support and not have any compensation or any additional support or escalation is ridiculous. Shame on you Apple. You are tricking your customers into believing you ofer superior support, service and products."
"Worst customer service for such an acclaimed product. Never buy Apple if you want good customer service. People on the phone for the repair service are worthless. Your computer goes into an abyss and no information is available. I waited on hold for 10 minutes to talk with customer relations and then got cut off. I hate to think about the billions of dollars of profit this acclaimed tech company is making and isn’t going out of their way to provide good service. No more Apple products for me. I’m soooooo done!!!!!"
"I phone 5s wont do a thing! total poopy! company!You cant just expect your users to BUY A NEW PHONE AND THEY ALSO PASS THE PHONES ON TO THEIR KIDS!!!!! NOT VERY CLEVER ARE YOU"
"Terrible customer service! When my package didn’t arrive after 2 weeks they were awful at helping me and I felt they were very rude over the phone as I tried to deal with the situation with customer service. Won’t be buying directly from Apple again."
"Crack screen issues for over a month still no help from apple"
"My iPhone X started sending pics of my wife Nude that she shared with me to individuals in my phone as I am watching it do so I than it sent cash app payments to other people in my phone as well I contacted sprint and they said it was software issues contact apple I than send my phone in for repair and they drop the ball and either misplaced my phone or just didn’t get it to the right place weeks go by I am paying a bill for the line as well as the phone was needed for medical issues as well spoke with customer relations they signed off on a iPhone 12 for my inconvenience and than sent me a iPhone X That wasn’t good business practice and I am a business man as well as long time customer all my kids and grandkids have iPhones never did I think I would be even having this bad Reveiw F for. Apple🍎"
"They sent my iPad to the wrong address and now will not refund me until they receive it back at there warehouse.NOT MY FAULT APPLE. I’ve been waiting nearly a month. And customer services are useless!Refund my money!!!!!!"
"Mac book Air 2 months old. The logic Board broke. It needs 2 weeks to get sorted. Bad customer support and they do not care if you are in the middle of a pandemic as a student with no laptop. They lost a customer who every year was buying at least one apple product."
"Terrible customer service. There are no appointments available for the next 7 days at any store in Illinois. Been trying to schedule an appointment for last 7 days."
"I loved Apple. They were focused on the creative professional. Life was good until there was a management change. Now the company makes it difficult for creative professionals to even get access to their own documents. Note how impossible an act it is to put your own video content onto your iPhone. Additionally, Apple wants everyones intellectual property on their servers. Apple has forgotten that they have no right to IP. In fact most companies will not allow their secure information to go onto any cloud let alone the fallible servers at Apple. (No, Apple is not perfect and apple has no business even glancing at medical or engineering files). The bottom line, Apple does not serve professionals. It serves consumers. If you are looking for pokemon call Apple. If you need an R&R on your foundation design for your multi-million dollar installation then perhaps you should buy a PC. I owned seven Macs once. Now I own 6 PCs and 1 Mac. The mac is always an issue, always the problem child. I long for the old days of Apple."
"If I could rate the service and product a zero I would. Two iPhones (one iPhone8 plus and an iPhone XR) that both are in a frozen loop My second phone (the first one they couldn’t fix yet it was a few months old) has only been in my possession since March has frozen again. Technical support week far from technical and James sounded completely uninterested and lacked empathy, knowledge and found it really difficult to process what I was saying. I had to drag an apology out of him while he seemed to read from a script which he repeated over. He offered no suggestions to my frozen screen and was saying ‘goodbye’ before I had explained in full. We now have an hour drive to our apple store and can’t be seen fur an appointment until the end of the week. Frustrated beyond belief and no explanation what their issue is with the frozen screen. Friends have also said that this has happened to them! We have an apple MacBook and 3 apple iPads! I am no longer an apple fan, the worst customer service I think I’ve ever experienced!"
"I am very disappointed to discover that greed has overwhelmed apple to the point where they have stooped so low as to tell the tech support not to spend more than 15 min with someone who has an older mac and that they should buy a new one or they are on their own. I was unable to get on the net because I needed to upgrade the OS. They told me to go and get a disk at the store and after waiting a week for an appointment I was told by the store that I would have to get it from tech support. After going back and forth for weeks to get this resolved, even going as far as sending an email to the CEO which was never answered, and being treated with contempt by supervisors, also being told that there is nothing that could be done and that I need to buy a new computer I have decided to switch to Microsoft. If I have to buy new it will NEVER be another apple product. The experience has made me understand why apple only has 8% market share."
"I have been an apple fan for a long time but after the latest purchase of an iPhone 11 I'm not so faithful. The new phone has a cable but no plug to charge the phone with. I rang Apple and they told me I have to buy one! So I paid £599 for a new phone and cannot charge it. I don't have any plugs that fit the cable! Well done Apple!"
"An excellent customer service from Irene today. I had a issue with my order and she managed to sorted it in a seconds. She made my day so thank you very much."
"Absolutely terrible customer service lost my order and didn't do much do fix it. I am a very loyal apple customer and I ordered an iPhone 12 direct from apple on a preorder. I have ordered from them before and had no issues. iPhone was delayed fair enough. I phoned customer service and was told DHL hadn't confirmed to them if the phone had been lost their end so they would start an investigation and they refunded me my iphone case and would be in touch on the status of my order. Again fair enough. More weeks passed and I kept calling them as absolutely no updates from them at all. Kept being told that the investigation was ongoing and DHL had still not confirmed that the phone was lost. There was nothing they could do until the investigation was over and couldn't send me a new phone out. This has been going on for three weeks now. No updates. No phone. I have to keep ringing them to be told we can't do anything yet until investigation over no phone can be sent out to me. No next steps nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and am I still waiting for them to call me back. Terrible way to treat a customer.  What they should have done was to send out a new phone to their customer while they continued their seemingly endless investigation. I will never order direct from them and neither should you. Far better to use a trusted retailer in New Zealand."
"- Expensive- Misplaced my AirPods and the ""find my phone"" app was basically useless. Never found them.- Customer Service was very poor. Didn't have any knowledge about how the products work and answered all my questions with ""hard to say"".- Gave me false information and website during customer service."
"I opened a LinkedIn app to try to trace a freind. The app offered job offer opportunities by filling in ones criteria to job match. I thought why not ? Times are hard and my job not secure. I have two teenage  dependencies both in education. The job ‘matches’ were obsurd. I work in catering with management experience. The jobs were for Executives and IT consultants which on an average of 6 a day GLOBALLY during a PANDEMIC. Out of my league,  out of reach in every aspect and NO match what’s so ever and VERY irritating pinging my phone with a reminder of what other people can earn treble my monthly salary in a day.THEN weeks later I get an email from Apple offering additional services for little extra cost ! What cost ? So I look at my bank statements and find they’ve been taking £49,99 a MONTH out of my account for this “service” !!!I contacted them immediately and got very polite emails asking me to follow links in order to resolve matters. I refused and instructed them to contact me. I gave them my phone number and they said they’d phone at 10.00 a.m today which I explained was perfect as later than that I was working and couldn’t be on the phone. I got a call from an unknown number at 18.30, when I was still working and didn’t give enough rings for me to get the phone out my pocket to answer it I then received an email saying “ we’ve been trying to contact you” ! I transferred some money fromsavings into my current account in order to avoid additional bank interest charges and noticed it was £49.99 short. WHY ? Because APPLE TOOK MY MONEY AGAIN WHILST DISTRACTING ME WITH FALSE PROMISES OF A DELYED PHONE CALL AFTER THEY’D AREADY TKEN THE MONEY !!! That’s assuming it was even them who called me at all ! No emails, just KNOWINGLY STOLE MY MONEY THE DAY AFTER I TOLD THEM I WANTED THE SUBSCRIPTION I MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY SIGNED TOO CANCELLED ! DAY LIGHT ROBBERY OF A CUSTOMER STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY LIKE SO MANY AT THE MOMENT  FROM THE HEAD OF A CORPORATION WHO DOES “NICE GUY” PR STUNTS MAKING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A SECOND BY TRICKING AND ROBBING THE VENERABLE.  Put a mask on a cry “stand and deliver” instead ! SHAME on YOU. I will NOT let this LIE in the way you LIE to your “customers” through a veil. Come sue me why don’t you for slander ? The bad press will reveal the TRUTH.Daniel"
"Phoned Apple customer service, a guy names Carlos is so rude, he tried to educate me what should to do rather than listen to my problems, when I reported glue metled from item.He refused to tell the complaint number, any one can help?"
"Bad customer services, they took more than two days for any of customer support requests, they reject membership requests without any reason, verily BAD CUSTOMER SERVICES"
"Apple is not having my money again. They updated the software on my phone and its battery is not working as before anymore. Me or anyone i know will never buy Apple product again."
"Just had the misfortune of speaking to an agent that seemed as though he was working out of india, the usual I can’t put you through to anyone and scripted sentences without any help. I was very patient being of an ethnic background but frankly this person was rude and so unprofessional, I asked for a manger and was told he was the highest authority, I asked to make a complaint and was told he had already concluded the matter and then he hung up. Was really in two minds about buying an android phone this year but as I have a business and we use many of the latest apple products I decided against it. However I will be slowly moving away as it seems apple are doing the classic dump of service due to their scale."
"Just made my first ever phone call to Apple customer care after having just brought a Mac, the new I phone, 2 sets of air pods and a I pad in the past 2 months.The iPad I have been waiting for nearly a month now so I decided to call as it had a eta of between 7th 10th October and is still not showing as despatched.The lady I got through to struggled to hear any of my information so I had to repeat it 3 times and after saying sure I can help you with that took the most sarcastic arrogant attitude with me and said how was she meant to know where they were. She said I was being unrealistic to not expect a delay as it is Christmas they are extremely busy. As if I care I just want my products I have paid for!! She was laughing as I was trying get a date for delivery. What a absolutely disgusting representation for Apple.... take some care with your customers and hire polite staff!!"
"I’ve been with apple practically all my life and now is when I see that the quality is worse than ever .  Figures there made in China poor quality high prices.  PLEASE beware very dishonest and super expensive for what it promotes.  What a shame.  The owner should establish where he manufactures.  Obviously the reviews speak for itself."
"Bought the new iPhone 12 direct from Apple UK with the offer of Apple TV plus, free for a year. Despite over two hours, on live chat and subsequently on the telephone with support I'm still unable to activate the TV offer. Very disappointed. Will approach Apple in the future with far less trust."
"Just spent 3 phone calls trying to buy an née iPhone today . 2 hours of wasteful time very poorly trained customer service. Dishonest. This is not the Apple I know. What the heck is going on?"
"On the App Store it used to say FREE or the price on the button when downloading an app. Now it says GET.I downloaded a QR scanner, then after looking at an Apple invoice weeks later, I had been charged £9.49 per week for an app I’d used once. It says nothing about any charge on the screen at the time.As if Apple don’t have enough money without resorting to blatant theft.It is the last time I ever buy Apple."
"I am having issues with my phone whenever it’s connected to the charger and I receive a phone call then I answer it I get electric ⚡️ shock from where I place it against my ear, I have Apple Care+ but the support team won’t help me with my issues trying to play me around with their silly answers and they hanged up the phone after holding on a the line for 1hour and 12 minutes trying to speak to a senior advisor and the lady I was speaking to called Dana or Dani doesn’t want to help me the second time I called they made an appointment with me to speak to a senior advisor after 10-15 minutes from my call and nobody called me back, I called the third time they made an appointment again for the next day and the senior advisor said take off your case!!!!!!! Wow what a solution I never knew that paying £200 for a warranty is a waste of money with apple when you can just take off your phone case to stop the shock I am getting. keep in mind my case is silicone from apple paid £39 for it. What a great help from Apple. Will never ever buy anything from apple, I was planning to change my Apple Watch and ear pods to a newer version but that wont happened."
"I’m almost about to quit being an apple Buyer simply because of epic games I had money in that game and now it’s gone over the way apple wants them to do there money geese going back to android products"
"I have  tried countless times with apple to get a refund of $50. They have declined me twice with no explanation as to why I couldn’t be refunded. Apple has disappointed me highly. They do not want to help nor try to help. I see myself back with good ol’ trusty android before long."
"Just bought new iPhone 12 pro, spent over $1,000 and cant even use it because it doesn't come with a charger.  WTH"
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. At least 8 hours - EIGHT HOURS - in total on the phone over the course of several weeks. Passed around the entire population of Cork I should think. Never experienced anything as pathetic. Promised resolution/calls back/ refunds but Zero. Still not resolved. Genuinely shocked by the levels of incompetence I have experienced - I daresay more still to come. Can't wait. Jeeeeez. Amazing."
"Got Beats X earphone from apple, about one year time, Glue melted out and logo come down.Phoned Apple, they offer chargeable repair, which is higher than buying a new set now.Disappointed with them. Quality and customer service is too low."
"The machine itself is awesome, however APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE is NOT what is used to be. APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE is now TERRIBLE!!!Im talking APPLE will give you the run around, lie to you, transfer you around to wrong departments where the person has no idea what your talking about, even though the last Apple manager representative said that they would thoroughly inform the next representative you are being transferred to, about exactly what’s going on and what was promised.Shame on you APPLE! Mistreating a customer of yours that’s been using Apple products since the beginning! Apple customer service used to be top notch, now it’s simply awful.I Just upgraded from 2014 MBA to 2020 MBP that’s fully maxed out. I had the WORST experience ever buying from Apple directly. I had a little issue with my new MBP that I thankfully found out within 5 minutes of opening my new MBP. The CAPS LOCK key DOESN’T WORK!So I call 1800 Apple who then transferred me to another department, who then incorrectly, transferred me to the iPhone department (even though we were always discussing a MacBook Pro), who transfered me to Matthew in which him and I had a conversation and Matt scheduled a call back to me with resolution. After the call back from Matthew @ Apple in reguards to my issue and a promise/resolution he made me, he made me a promise to help me and then (yet again) I was blindly transferred me to the wrong department to a guy who had no idea what was going on. Even though Matt said he made the next representative fully aware of what Matt promised me and what’s going on. He even warmed transferred me over the the person and assured me that he informed the next department of what is going on. So, after Matt hangs up the 3 way, warm transfer and said goodby to me and the other Apple representative that Matt had warm transfered me to, the next representative HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON!!!! How incredibly frustrating. This was so frustrating, that I literally felt SICK for the whole day because of how much time and energy was wasted and how Apple could lie to you after making a promise and then blindly transferring you to someone whose supposed would be “totally filled in” about what’s going on, just for this representative to tell you the last representative “didn’t fill me in on anything” and that’s he’s really sorry but unfortunately can’t in ANY WAY get back over to Matthew (who we both just spoke to on the warm transfer). So Apple can’t even get you back into touch (not via phone transfer, not via notes, not via a call back with the representative (Matt) who you waited hours to talk to, who called you back and made you a promise that was NEVER FULLFILLED!!!!Oh and Apple representatives also told me there was absolutely NO NOTES on my account at all from Matthew, even though Matthew called me back from 1800apple with a resolution to my issue...So I ended up having several hours of my time wasted on the phone, transferred around over 12 different times, getting transferred to the wrong departments, getting told I had to wait 7 hours for a supervisor to call, and then being told it would be 10 DAYS for supervisor to call and that the previous representative shouldn’t have told me that I would get a supervisor call the same day. They said with coronavirus that they are really backed up with supervisor calls back. After that rude lady told me that, I was transferred to yet again the wrong department and had the phone call lost. I would stay clear of Apple. The customer service when down fast and is now terrible.What a shame Apple used to have the BEST customer service ever. I would avoid APPLE the customer service is NOT even HALF as good as it used to be. They don’t care about their customers anymore. It was perfectly obvious when you guys lied to me and had me on the phone for several hours for nothing, transferring me around to over 12 different phone transfers and you guys even lied to me about helping out this situation.Shame on you Apple!"
"I have been a satisfied iPad Pro 2019 (12.9”) user since I was given one when it first came out. However, I was also given a Smart Keyboard Folio, which is the worst keyboard I have ever used. The edges of the keyboard are heat sealed, like a plastic bag, and start to come apart within two months under normal usage. I didn’t have a receipt, so when mine reached the maximum level of decrepitude - literally came apart all around its edges - I went in to Bangkok’s smart new Apple Store and bought a second one for myself. Lo and behold, after two months, the same problem occurred with the new one, despite being carefully coddled. So I go back to the same store, receipt in hand, and the staff there, after considerable queuing, delays and whispered conversations, begrudgingly acknowledge that I was entitled to a new one. They first tried to allege that I’d had an accident and I had to argue with them that, no, this was a manufacturing defect - the edges are simply not wide enough for heat sealing to be reliable. After going through this treatment for 25 minutes, they then tell me they don’t have any in stock and I’d have to return in 14 days to undergo the same treatment, at my own expense. I asked them would they please deliver to my address, but no, they “have no such service”. The worst, most unco-operative, least sympathetic customer service imaginable. I walked out and will buy a third party product rather than buy anything from this company again."
"I am not pleased with customer service that I have received from the repair service team. I have expressed on a multitude of occasions that I do not want the left AirPod. I explained how I ordered the incorrect AirPod and instead of a cancelation I rather opt fo a correction of the order on November,4th less than 15 minutes after the order was placed. The young lady that I spoke to on that same day, told me that I would not be able to cancel my order despite just placing it less than 15 minutes ago ""because it has already shipped"". Fast forwarding  to present on November 5th, at 9:45 I received an email detailing that my order has just shipped and will be delivered on Friday. The young lady lied and stated that an order I vehemently expressed I did not won't nor had a need for could not be canceled on the fourth despite an email stating that it was shipped out on the 5th. I am very upset with the customer service and pray that Apple gets their repair center customer service in compliance with the actual customer. Apple does not cater to its consumer and I find that extremely abhorrent. currently reevaluating my consumer loyalty with this company."
"Now that that second lockdown has come myHard earned money that bought my recent airpods has now gone to waste I went to get it fixed at the Apple store in Stratford but apparently appointments were all booked up So I was told to ship my airpods and I was on the phone to customers service for a while and was told give my email address... tell me why they still haven’t reached Out to me to ship my airpods?!Apple have really disappointed me this time!"
"Bought an item & apple charged twice for it. Customer support for apple.com daisy “yes, we are preauthorizing items now” the second charge will fall off in 7 business days. What?!? No. Now, the item has been delivered, money taken out & 2nd payment is still pending. Joke. Never ordering from them again."
"After a 40 minute drive to nearest outlet only  to find  an appointment required , no one answered the 4 times I tried calling and nothing posted on their website to advise an appointment required my end result was almost 2 hours wasted , fuel wasted and aggravation. Combine this with the London Ontario managers sarcastic could care less attitude , the end result for Apple was the loss of a customer for life ."
"I wil never buy another apple product again. Everything I purchased doesnt sync with the newer models. And each new purchase means i have to purchase new accessories because i cannot use my older accessories with the new product...never again"
"Just uploaded the latest Apple update on my phones and now none of them will charge on the Apple cables/ wires that came with the phones .  Sorry it neither tech speak but I plugged my phone in to charge and it does not work!!! Literally from Pre latest down load to post! Now we are in Lock down I cant just pop into a store and get another! You really need to focus on you money making strategies, compared to you costumer services in times like these."
"Provided number not exist at all (LT). So you can't contact them."
"Never buy this Garbage from Apple!!!1. All products purchased from Apple Store do not correspond to the declared technical data.2. Employees of the company are disrespectful to their customers.3 A huge amount of bugs in the applications of this company.4. The cost of the product does not match its quality.Apple stop it making, we won't buy it anymore."
"amazing customer service...had an issue with the graphic card on my MacBook pro - apple fixed it for free!"
"Disgusting tactics. I have owned apple products for 18 years. I have an Apple TV 3 which I paid good money for, there is even an app called ‘Music’ in line with the successor to the atrocious ITunes...yet even though I’m paying for a £10pm subscription I would need to upgrade my Apple TV just to make use of it without crappy airplay quality audio. This is laughably insulting: it’s planned obsolescence which I really don’t find funny anymore. Just like most of their tactics in general these daysI’ll go back to Spotify and my raspberry pi and will quite literally never buy an Apple product ever again; this is an utter joke Go screw yourselves apple, I’m done"
"I've always had Apple iphones, what I don't like is that when you want the latest phone you've got to wait until your contract has ended. Is literally bought the new one, then a few months later they brought another one out. I had to wait over 18 months to get it though."
"independent repair companies wont be able to repair your screen or cameras on your iphone 12 because apple decided to make it so it can detect that its not the same screen and just wont work right until you bring it to apple themselves while also there repair people all they do is look and tell you to buy a new iphone."
"Absolute garbage. Am sick and tired of dealing with this greedy company. When your phone gets updated it deletes all of your music playlists. The only way to get them back, according to Apple user forums, is to pay a subscription fee for Apple music. Disgusting money grab and time-wasting, obnoxious shitshow."
"I am apple users as well. I bought air pod from 3rd person when I went to but I did not know this person or scammer but all I am literate person I check with the serial key on apple web site address and it shows that it is valid product and has valid one year warranty and after 3 months I have problem in the air pod when I called them I found has not valid product is unauthorized. I told them they said we can not provide you any services they said they might has took some one else box and give to you. so I replied that can you please let me know is it possible for them to hack apple web site and put serial key which is valid and have 1 year warranty.they said it is not possible. then my replied was yes I have trust your web site only, sir."
"I love apple phones. I was always an apple fan. Up until the iPhone 6 I have. After that, no more head phones. I wanted to buy the iPhone X. But there was no head phone jack. Also, I liked the finger print scanner. Face ID is over rated. Because now everyone wears a mask. Bring back the head phone jack and finger print scanner, or RIP. Other wise I am going to switch."
"I have been trying to get a repair appt for the last three weeks and I get the same answer ""no appt available you need to keep trying"".  I asked to speak to a supervisor and they can't help me either. They are nice not rude at all but unable to helping me. Basically I was told to keep calling!  I asked to chat with an advisor at 12 midnight and I could perhaps get an appt.  This didn't work either!!"
"The worst customer service.  Was not able to remove activation lock on my own 700 dollar IPAD.  Apple is going down the tubes. In the past, a great company but I will never buy from them again.  After 20 hours on the phone they were not able to resolve my issue including a trip to the apple store.  They are no where near the company they used to be. Buyers beware!"
"I am so incredibly sick and tired of spending days and weeks, wasting my time sorting out flaws and quirks with Apple systems. I have spent a small fortune over the years to try and maintain my equipment, but just as I start making progress, THEY CHANGE SOMETHING, OR ""UPGRADE"" and down we all crash to the bottom again. When my Macs and Logic are running, they are superb, but it never lasts, and we are forced to continually buy buy buy,, not by choice, or to move forward, but just to stand still. Saying stand still is now a mute point, because having moved from Logic 8 and 9 (which I loved) I now find they have dumped waveburner, and as usual with Apple, there is nothing I can do about it. Really seriously want to love them, but I detest the comany with a passion."
"I admire this company so very much, I like the premium feel of their products"
"Not a surprise seeing all the poor reviews for Apple customer service related to Iphones.  Apple is run like a life insurance company.  Life Insurance companies are well known for doing everything they can to prevent lying out claims.  Their process seems to be set up to prevent Covering warranties for phones that do not work.  I purchased a phone in May and Apple gave me every excuse why they should not replace it.  I spoke to a Supervisor who explained he is the top supervisor and he still would not help.  Android phone here I come.  I am done with Apple products."
"I'm so sick of Apple's lack of consideration for the folks that have bought their systems. The SuperMouse is a piece of cr*p. Service is just as bad. Don't expect to get any work done using their devices. Just pony up and pay for a mouse that actually works. Apple will never know."
"2 days old. Love my new 12Pro.  I sit down in a lawnchair to tie my shoes and my 12 falls out of my pocketand 💥 the screen shatters.  No more than 2 feet.Obviously, the highly vaunted super screen is simply marketing hype. Or maybe, there was a manufacturing glitch that rendered a vulnerability.I have an appointment with Apple at the Pentagon City store to replace the screen or the phone.$275 to get a new screen, but warranty is compromised.We’ll see if Apple does the right thing and replaces my phone.Stand back and stand by for more details on Apple’s response.More to follow, positive or negative.MikeUPDATE!Happy News!You may purchase Apple Care after-the-fact for 60 days after you buy an Apple product. I did so.  Made an appointment and went in last week to get a new screen.  The reps I dealt with at the Tyson’s Corner store, Linda and Rene, could not have been nicer!  In and out within 30 minutes, and they simply issued me a BRAND NEW PHONE!  Way to go, Apple! Thank you!  Very happy!  Mike"
"i don't understand why i have to wait 24 hours and then another 27 days to reset my password and find my phone, it's stupid. fix this."
"Having to buy charger seperate with iphone 12 is just a money grab"
"Had Apple for a long time, my son took my credit card put it on my phone ran a bill up tried to get a refund was denied I didn’t make the charges it was games, some charges was with in 72 hours, so that tells u Apple does not have great service, the charges few weeks ago I can understand  but the with in 72 hours Couldn’t get refunded, that tells you they don’t take care of there customers"
"The new update is absolutely ridiculous. Apple CarPlay font size is so tiny. I want an android now. I am so disappointed."
"Not everyone wants to buy a phone on a plan through a company so I tried ordering an ""unlocked"" iPhone 12 pro. Each time I tried ordering it gets cancelled. Called customer care they're telling me it got cancelled because of multiple purchases. Hmmm so I wonder why I had to do multiple purchases???? BECAUSE THE ORDERS ARE CANCELING. This was the worst experience I've ever had trying to purchase a phone. I've been through Samsung with no major problems so I'm just gonna stick with them."
"I have had two pairs of Beats X headphones made by Apple. Both pairs lasted little over 6 months. They were then replaced and broke 6 months after that. Over £100 for a pair of head phones that only worked just past the warranty period. Apple were not interested in replacing them. I’m not buying Apple products again they are a premium product which is cheaply produced and do not care about a loyal customer base."
"Let me start by saying I love the products Apple produces, however, the support and customer quality care they offer is something else. The individuals working for Apple aren’t bad it’s how Apple chooses to run its business is what is. I literally had a supervisor tell me they can’t reset an Apple ID password because it was all done by computer. So where is the human client care??? None! Apple’s client care is being done by computer and a human being can’t even step in and fix an issue an Apple employee created to begin with! How’s that for service! Please someone create a quality product like Apple does but offer better customer service. Can’t wait for that day to happen!"
"The battery in my watch went flat so I put it on charge. When I went to put it on again the back was so hot it singed the hairs on my wrist, there was a small pop and I got a “shock”. Then I notice the screen had come away at the front.After discussing in store and with Apple Support they all say this is normal for a watch 2-3 years old - saying they battery hadn’t exploded, just “expanded”.  Customer support gave me the run around for 2 weeks then basically said “checked with our legal department and not our problem”. Seems super dangerous- and to think I was going to upgrade to a new one and give my old one to my 11 year old son. I’m glad I didn’t!I won’t be buying Apple again - too many stories of exploding batteries and no accountability from Apple who deny its an issue and won’t replace it as a faulty item"
"Their technical support is the worst experience I have had EVER with phone support. My APPLE ID was shut down because I changed my number and restarted phone to factory settings. When back on all info continued going to my old number. Email addresses not accessible because I changed them with APPLE’s complex passwords suggested. I have been going through this restore account process for TWO DAMN WEEKS and still hasn’t happened. One day it tells me that I will be able to open account in 5 days, and 3 days later representative says restoring never happened and wasn’t on their notes of actions. I have call continuously and haven’t been given answers. Still playing phone tag with these people. I have NO CONTACTS, NO ACCESS TO ANY SOCIAL MEDIA, NO EMAILS (so the job I was waiting to hear back from....GONE!!). I AM PISSED OFF!!!! AND THE MOMENT MY ACCOUNT IS BACK, I’m backing up all my info and will no longer work with Apple to ANY EXTENT. I used to love and want nothing but Apple...now I want nothing to do with Apple!"
"Worst customer service and worst value for money. I am sick to the back teeth of buying apple products and have the device deliberately slowed down or experience issues with the functionality to make me buy a new device!!I have also just tried to buy a iPhone 12 on Barclays finance, which was approved on both email from Barclay's and on the Apple website, to be then told Apple hadn't received my order!!!They refused to take responsibility or even send out an email stating my finance from Barclay's had been cancelled.Very helpful Apple, very helpful."
"Nesta is a idiot. and apple is the worst product out there."
"I have presented apple watch (series 5) to my wife, as her phone was not compatible waited for iPhone 12, she ordered iPhone 12 pro (pre-ordered), she try to check the watch it didn't power on she tried to charge still same spoke to online tech support they issue not resolved booked appointment visited local store watch collated they have to sent back to repair centre, my wife is very disappointed as brand new peace as big brand apple has these type of product quality (very poor) now she is rejecting my present asking she will cancel iPhone order she love to continue with android phone and android watch.this is very disappointed me I have been using iPhone last 10 years. not sure how I can convince my wife now ( I should have not chosen apple product as present)"
"Recently accepted a trade in offer for a watch when purchasing a new watch. Apple now only gives gift cards instead of refunding money back to your account on trade ins. Better to sell on the open market than to get a gift card that forces you to order from Apple again. Shady!"
"My laptop doesn't charge. It goes up and down, so I called apple support and since there is no apple repair in Uppsala it was sent via mail to where? Eastern Europe! is this environmentally friendly? I love it how brands sell their BS and then don't live at all the values they preach. On top of everything it took them 1 month and 9 days to get my laptop back. 800 euros later: I get ,my laptop with the same issue! it still does not charge and my speakers are broken! this is a 2017 model it should not have any of this and in the repair they broke it more! the only official apple store here is outside of Stockholm - takes two hours to get there on public transportation in a pandemic! combined hours waiting on the phone sum 11!!!!!! I'm not even making this up ! I have waited for 11 hours! on the phone! Now they tell me I have to go to the apple store to leave it again for the guarantee of the repair. NOT BUYING APPLE AGAIN"
"Love the productLove the service"
"Bought Apple AirPods only 10 months old still under manufacturer warranty Will only replace if I put a down payment off £130 or travel 2 hours by train to pick a unpair up Rude staffNo complaints producer in the UK My AirPods cost me £200 they lasted 10 months"
"The fact you don’t get a charger with your new iPhone 12 is ridiculous... apparently something to do with carbon emissions (laughable). But then you have to buy the charger separately either way as they are different to earlier models... like Apple need the extra money! Extremely bad move in my opinion. Greedy"
"Rude people,expecially in instagram page that block menanyway who cates? With my invalidity sign I will never can buy Apple product"
"Never buying Apple products ever. I have an iPad and it is crap. I have ridiculously fast Internet, but iPad can’t even process fast Internet. iPad glitches all the time. My phone that cost me $1000 dollars always has glitches and gets stuck so I have to wait for it to die. I can’t deal with this. I also just recently bought a McBook pro, but after a week I didn’t think I wanted it so I wanted to return it, but after paying $2500 for it the best they could do was $600 😅 Apple is ridiculous and I hope someone day their crappy corrupt company loses tons of money."
"Apple lost 7 customers today because that’s how many people are in my immediate household. My 5 year old made purchased on his iPad and when I submitted these purchases for refund they were denied although a 5 year old obviously isn’t legally able to make any purchase anywhere. There should be stops in place for purchases to be made and it shouldn’t be so easy to buy hundreds of dollars worth of inventory that a 5 year old can do it.  For a company who claims to care about security its mind boggling that they’d create a simple way for someone who isn’t me to make purchases against my account without ensuring my permission and without having multiple stops in place. It’s also mind boggling that they don’t have a fraud prevention department like my bank has to notify a customer of odd purchase patterns like $100 worth of individual purchases on CLUMSY NINJA and TOMS & FRIENDS two games very obviously geared towards children. Especially when more children are learning on iPads than ever before due to a global pandemic. Way to look out for your customers at a time when they need it most. I will never purchase another Apple product or service as long as I live. I removed all forms of payment from everything related to Apple and canceled every subscription I have with Apple and am moving all devices to Amazon Kindle and Samsung Android and let my bank know that going forward no purchases from any Apple vendor should be accepted against my account. I have 6 other people in my household and Apple lost every single one of us today over some simple refund requests when I’ve never in 20 years asked them to refund anything else. Don’t buy anything from Apple. They are not a secure product if I have to jump through 16 hoops to keep my 5 year old from making hundreds of dollars worth of purchase without my knowledge or consent. I should have to change settings to allow purchases not to prevent them. There should be stops in place for purchases to be made and it shouldn’t be so easy to buy hundreds of dollars worth of inventory that a 5 year old can do it."
"My advice in one sentence is, DO NOT BUY AN IPHONE OR ANY OTHER APPLE PRODUCT.So I have an iPhone 6 that just refuses to download the latest IOS to it and I mean the latest compatible IOS and I also have an iPhone 7 that also refuses to download the latest IOS.I have even contacted Apple for help and they didn’t help and kept advising things that didn’t work.Apple have even admitted they deliberately slow down their devices after a few years.Steer clear, my next phone will be a Samsung. Apple have lost my custom after nine years and good riddance.Apple are finished, sour grapes? No.Bitter apples? Yes."
"If I could give only half a star, that's my real rating. I bought a Mac Mini in January, 2020, and there has been one problem after another. Some of it is the Catalina OS, some of it in their apps, some in the false claims made by the salesperson, some in their poor quality connectors for those of us who need to use wires (not a Luddite, just get headaches from blue tooth, etc, and try to avoid those at home) and some of it in their updates. There have been so many problems and weak points that I could write pages on this.I have had to make more contact to Apple help in the past 10 months than I have to any one computer company in the past 10 years, and I keep my desktop computers for a long time (laptops, not so long). Suffice to say that I won't be buying any more apple products. I might dislike Windows 10, which is what drove me to switch, but this is worse. This has been a waste of money and time for me."
"I have been a Apple customer for over 15 years. The Apple products I currently own are: an iPad Pro 12.9 2nd generation, an Apple Pencil, an iPhone XS, Aipords first generation, Beats Studio 3. I used to own a Macbook Pro 15"" 2018 full specification laptop. I have had nothin but incredible customer service with Apple.The only issue I had was that I wanted to play AAA games on the go and I need a Windows gaming laptop for that. To solve this problem, I sold my Macbook Pro at a great price (Apple products keep their value more than the competition) and I bought an affordable Dell gaming laptop.Being introduce to the horrible customer service from the PC World made me instantly regret my decision (especially since Dell is rated as having one of the worse customer service experience ever).I plan on selling my gaming laptop and coming back to Apple.Apple might not have the best products for all of our needs, but one thing is for sure their customer service and their resell value beat the competitions, hands down."
"Macbook Air 2017 is functioning worse than Macbook Air 2015. Reminds me of the episode in the movie about Steve Jobs, when he had to fight about interior and exterior perfection of every Apple product. Some issues of 2017:- battery was lasting for 4-5 hours- today, mac shut down at 50%battery- when restarting, date goes to Dec 31, giving multipe error messages across apps.- slow operation"
"before you buy an iphone 12 do your research!!apple no longer supply in the box :1) no charge adapter. so you have to buy it separate, for probably around the £25 mark.2) no earphones...yes !! they have removed the earphones , so you no longer get earphones with your new phone anymore...again sold seperately by apple for around £30-40so a brand new iphone...is all you get, no earphones, no charge adapter, just phone and a flimsy usb cable..thats why the box is so slim , BECAUSE ITS ALMOST EMPTY !!!!!and their excuse is to reduce carbon footprint...HAHA!!seriously people...keep your wallets shut or go to samsung who wont sell you a watered down product at FULL PRICE"
"I ordered an iPad Pro online after the store told me it would be faster to get it online as they would have to move stock from another location. After 6 weeks (yes, 42 days later!!!!), I finally got a shipping notice from UPS that it was on it's way, scheduled for next day delivery. On the delivery day, the notification changed to 'return to sender'.  Apple failed to include the proper documentation with the package and UPS deemed it unsafe for delivery. So back to Apple it went. Still waiting to find out what next... All I know is that my classes started 8 weeks ago and I am no longer an Apple customer. What a joke. If you're going to milk people on the pricing, at least back it up by delivering."
"Recently changed my iCloud account. When I was about to update an app, it wanted me to change my password and wait for verification for 3 days, even though I remembered my password. Get something better than apple."
"I ordered the new iPhone 12 Pro a week ago and I got specific instructions from apple to go to the apple store between a 15-min window to pick it up. When I went there, the apple employee told me that I need to wait on a line with about 2hour waiting...When I told him that I had an appointment for this particular time window, he responded that so do all these people. To make the long story short...I came back home and called Apple. They just didn't care. So, I canceled my order! They made me feel lime an idiot...I am about to spend one grant to buy your product and I have to wait on a line for about 2 hours...Why do they feel that they do me a favor? No way! I respect myself...I have an iphone 11 pro and I am fine to keep it for the next zillion years. There is NO WAY that I am buying another iphone ever again!"
"worst company after Jobs passed away. Mediocre products at best and new iPhone 12 is a bit spit in every customers face. No more apple crap from now on!!!! we don't give a charger and headphone to reduce carbon emissions (big spit on our faces) but we will sell them to make a huge profit!!! biggest b.s. I have ever heard! NO more apple crap!!!!!!"
"Apple AirPod pro product is the worst product I have owned by Apple. It worked well for a couple months and then started having problems with my right ear pod. After many hours on the web and then with customer service trying to repair the problem they ultimately wanted to try one piece at a time. When requested to replace the whole unit since it appears that at least two of the three components were malfunctioning they required me to pay over $300 in advance for them to send me a refurbished unit to try. I have no idea when my money will come back but as they get the interest on my money until they have to send it back. So they in fact get the float, another reason why they are $1 trillion market CAP Company by screwing their customers. I could purchase a whole new set from Amazon last week for $199.  If you dig deeper you will find out there are a lot of problems with the AirPod pro. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere."
"A little bit in how to do things and a lot less pictures of what's available would make life much easier - give proper answers to problems rather than endless pictures of what Apple sell or will be selling.  I believe its called customer service!!"
"the worst in the world! That added to the fact that with their new Catalina crap where they blocked 32 bits apps, they are forcing you to use only their products!!!!!This is a tyranical, dictatorial, fascist company that wants to control your life. Hate it."
"I was expecting a delivery today so I stayed home. At 10.30 am I got an iMessage telling me there was an attempted delivery at 09.30 but no one was home. The fact is we were all at home !No one called, they just sent a message one hour later.As they don't give any scheduled time (even a 4 hour slot would be appreciated), they should make sure you are not at home before leaving. This is not acceptable. Of course, the Apple Store Customer Service will ask to call me next time they try to deliver but that will be tomorrow not today (still no slot)."
"I had an issue with my iPad Pro where the keyboard had lag. I got help from several apple tech support. I was handled with respect and routed to experienced tech support . It took several lengthy sessions and ended with a final solution. Not sure what caused the issue but it got solved. They never gave up on me. Great job."
"I HAVE BEEN A LONG TERM CUSTOMER OF APPLE AND PURCHASED NUMEROUS PRODUCTS FROM THEM INCLUDING MY MAC BOOK AND I PHONE AT WHICH TIME WAS VERY SUITED FOR MY BUSINESS NEEDS.I DO NOT PROFESS TO BE TECHNICALLY MINDED WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTERS BUT APPLE WOULD MOST OF THE TIME SORT ANY PROBLEMS WHEN ASKED AND I HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO NAVIGATING THEIR SYSTEM SET-UP.WITH MY CURRENT COMPUTER I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO UP- GRADE AND PURCHASE A NEW ONE SO I JOURNEYED TO THE HIGH CROSS IN LEICESTER IN ANTICIPATION WITH WALKING AWAY WITH A NEW MODEL -    WRONG!!!!I WAS GREETED BY ONE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WHO ASKED ME THE PURPOSE OF MY VISIT WHICH I DULY EXPLAINED.THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN STORE WHEN I GLANCED IN ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF COVID 19 IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.ALTHOUGH I WHOLLY AGREE THAT THIS IS RIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING STATED ON THEIR WEB SITE OR AT THEIR DOOR THAT THIS WAS THE CASE AND ONLY VERBALISED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE.I HAD TAKEN A LONG JOURNEY AND PRECIOUS TIME FROM MY BUSINESS TO SPEND APPROX. £2,500 ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT THREE HOURS TWIGGLING MY THUMBS BEFORE I COULD SEE ANYONE!!! GREAT SERVICE APPLE ..........RETURNING HOME AND DEFLATED I PHONED THE APPLE BUSINESS SUPPORT TEAM TO EXPLAIN MY SUITUATION AS TO WHY IS IT I COULD HAVE VENTURED INTO A CURRYS STORE OUTLET WITH NO PROBLEM ENTERING AND TO PURCHASE THE SAME ITEM THERE, EVEN WITH COVID 19 AND ALL SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE AND NO PROBLEM GETTING ASSISTANCE.THE REPONSE WAS THAT THERE WAS SOME RESTRICTIONS TO WALK IN OF SOME THE APPLE STORES BUT COULD NOT IDENTIFY HIGH CROSS, LEICESTER AS BEING ONE OF THEM.I ASKED TO BE TRANSFERED BACK TO THE HIGHCROSS STORE FOR AN EXPLANATION.IT TRANSPIRES THAT THERE IS NO INFORMATION BEFORE YOU MAKE A LONG JOURNEY TO THE LEICESTER APPLE STORE ABOUT APPOINTMENTS, AND IF YOU DO,YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE CHANCE THAT IT IS NOT BUSY AND THAT YOU CAN ENTER OTHERWISE YOU CAN BE WAITING FOR HOURS, AS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER ELSE TO DO, THEN MAYBE,JUST MAYBE, YOU CAN SPEND YOUR VERY HARD EARNED MONEY WITH THEM AND BE VERY THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVLIDGE.I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT APPLE HAS NOW COME OF AGE OF A PLUTOCRACY AND DISTINCTLY COMES ACROSS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT FRONT YOUR ORGANISATION BUT PLEASE DONT FORGET THOSE WHO HAVE ELEVATED YOU THERE AND LIKE OTHER LARGE CORPRATES CAN EASILY FALL ON YOUR SWORD. I FOR ONE WOULD RATHER NOT SUPPORT YOU AT ALL WHEN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS IN DISARRY AND CLEARLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE LEFT HAND IS DOING FROM THE RIGHT."
"Tamra was so nice, she helped me get my money back from my card and she was so helpful and so sweet about everything! thank you so much tamra, you rock❤️~kendra"
"Highly untrained and unqualified customer service reps. I have had to deal with lies, misinformation and terrible customer ‘care’ from various individuals. Took 4-5 days to finally speak with a customer service rep who wasn’t completely lost. Now I’m getting random messages that I need to trade in my phone before I receive my new phone. So according to these representatives, I will be without a phone for 2-4 weeks until the new one arrives. Everywhere you search online, including their website states: On the Apple Card Monthly Payments; Once you receive your new phone, transfer your information, erase your old phone and send the old phone back for trade in. These service reps literally told me to erase my phone and send it in without even receiving a trade in kit or my new phone.They lack knowledge, training, and qualifications. They also lack common sense. Start paying for dependable, half-decent service representatives or you are going to lose a giant portion of your customer base. It happened to AT&T and it will happen to Apple too, if they do not improve."
"NOT GOOD FROM A COMPANY THIS BIG, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE"
"Apple is a premium company so you would expect high quality products, and they deliver but they overcharge for repairs and their support teem needs to get a real update."
"Worst customer service ever. Nobody knows what to do. Every customer service representative straight up lies.I had to schedule repair for airpods and that took a month. Now I had to get to schedule a phone return and spoke to 20 people and everyone just says different story and keeps you on hold"
"Brand new iPhone 11 Max pro, faceID stopped working. Via mail it takes 5 days just to send the phone and more number of days to get it back. No replacement phones too. Absolutely junk service. Left with a fault phone until apple sorts the problems on their own time."
"3 Months gonna be with this last 20 days delay. It should be a joke but it's not. When I ordered that stuff in mid of august I was thinking It d come 1 month later. You sent me a defective product and of course, it`s returned now you are saying the new iPad ll come In mid of November. Are you punishing me with time? If you are a really good foundation at least you should have sent with a cargo plane. You took my money as well as my time then you are serving nothing!Edit: They put off again another 2 weeks I swear I ll not buy again this brand`s product"
"Never buy apple. Always on presentation of new models, the old one start work very bad."
"On the phone as i write this.Nearly all my apple devices are not working (Left airpod stopped, screen cracked and imac works worst than a 1994 desktop).Talking to a representative is a pain, stores are limited due to covid, they requesting to send in the devices through the mail from 7 to 14 days!! Its a freaking joke!!Not worthmy money, used to be good, not anymore.Be aware!Update:Was told from one of their representatives to Keep Trying! What a joke!"
"(I would not give Apple one star - this review space requires that I give them at least one star)  I was probably a little hasty in trying a new product - Apple.  Traditionally I purchase my communications devices from LG - mostly because they are affordable.  For another in my household, I had innocently purchased used Apple phones - again and again I purchased used Apple phones because it was the most affordable option for me.  After eventually purchasing my own new Apple product I recently learned about a great disturbing deal.  Now I know the Apple platform/policies and processes have been instrumental factors in encouraging thriving criminal markets.  Those criminal markets are exploiting the customer vulnerabilities promoted by Apple platform/policies and processes.  Together with the criminal market, Apple has helped produce systemic programming that is crippling those who legitimately want something worth having.  Don't buy Apple phones through second hand merchants, don't repair your Apple phone at repair shops - like I used to do.  In fact, don't buy new Apple phones until they come through with significant stop gap measures to end the exploitation of people - especially our youth who are being dragged under into a criminal system that Apple helped build.  This is coming from a single mother - in the US, who has been made to be a victim, and whose child has been exploited by the criminal organization that takes advantage of Apple's platform, policies, processes, and the innocent."
"I Love this website, during the Corona Pandemic I have been using this more and more. The consumer service is amazing!"
"I downloaded a routine update to my phone the other day and boy was that a mistake! Im now left with a phone that does not make or receive calls and is showing no service i tried going through the system and tried myself to rectify the problem even a live chat has failed to solve the problem so well done apple i have had to buy a new phone as i have not had a working phone for 3 days obviously i did not buy one of your phones and never will. Very poor service from you indeed and yes you cant ring me as you put in your email thats because my phone does not work thanks to you."
"Apple is overpriced for products that are FAR worse than their competitors"
"I've had my iphone for just on 2 years. I purchased the 64gb, the OS uses 9gb apparently leaving me with 55gb. My photos, vids and apps use a combined 33 gb which should leave me with 22 gb space...Not so. I'm copping the infamous 'no available storage' msg.I deleted videos and photos and it showed 5gb available data.20 minutes later (without using my phone) I get another 'no available storage' msg. True enough, i'm on 0 gb available with 55gb used, yet now only 28gb used and theoretically I should now have 27gb availableI delete another cache of photos and apps, now it shows 2.5gb available. An hour later that has also disappeared. I will never, ever buy another apple product as long as I live. Good luck turning their reputation around in time for Electric Apple Cars hitting the market, who would ever buy a car with a 2 year shelf life?"
"I am literally heartbroken. I never want to purchase Apple products again. The iphone 11 experience I had was horrible, I've actually been crying over it. Bought an iphone at the Apple store, along with insurance, and unlimited icloud storage just last week. Yesterday my boyfriend proposed while we were pumpkin picking and then surprised me with an engagement/30th birthday party. We took a bunch of photos on my phone. At the end of the party, my phone starting going through a restart loop and kept turning on & off, only making it to the start screen with the apple icon before turning off and going black. It continued that way for over 24 hrs, so I took it to the Apple store where they said they could restore the phone or trade it in, but because I didn't back up my phone in two days none of the pics from the proposal would be there. I checked icloud and only some photos showed up for some reason, and of course the one selfie of us with my hand (you know, that basic ""We're engaged"" photo) is not there. The folks at the Apple store were sympathetic to me not wanting to restore my phone there, and pointed me in the direction of a tech company who may be able to open up my phone and grab the photos out of storage that way. However, that would likely not fall under insurance so on top of what I just paid for the phone, I would have to pay this company to get into my phone, and then I would need the phone back in the original condition in order to get it exchanged at Apple. I'm wondering what I can possibly do. Either I have to pay more many than I just paid last week to see if the photos are salvageable and maybe not be able to return my phone, or I definitely won't see those photos again. Just goes to show how reliable Apple products are. At least the Apple store employees were nice and did truly want to help after hearing the situation. This has put such a dark cloud over one of the best days of my life."
"I want to upgrade my niece iphone 11. which was purchase in april this year.To the iphone 12 and i have to buy another screen saver and case, with a trade in these things should be FREE!busterbose"
"HEY DUMBASSES. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LOCATE MY F*CKIN PHONE THROUGH ICLOUD.COM IF I NEED TO BE SENT A GODDAMN CODE TO MY F*CKIN PHONE TO VERIFY  WHO I AM???????"
"Wouldn’t even give it 1/5 if I was allowed. Absolutely disgusting. Such a huge company but a complete rip off. STAY AWAY!!! ConArtists!!!!!"
"So I sent in a phone to be repaired first I’m gone say I call maybe two months prior about a cracked screen an Apple worker told me u could get it fixed locally because I don’t have an Apple store near me now then recently my phone stop taking charge and the screen went black dent it in to Apple this time and they said they can’t fix it I had so many Apple workers tell different lies on this situation one said Apple can’t fix the phone anymore because a third party fixed my screen but the technician claim they can I have a letter from them proving this info another said I don’t have AppleCare plus but another said I did which I know I do also they email me stating they scan fix the phone but since but my phone is the only way I can look at my email so I couldn’t respond to it thanks Apple for showing great customer service i hope I never have to deal with you guys again horrible service and you blame a customer for a worker statement good job in your end"
"What a bad experience trying to buy an iPhone with Barclays. Apparently there was a disconnect between the two and although the Barclays part was successful, Apple didn't place an order. I have to try again, with a second credit check and a much later delivery date for the iPhone. This is the worst customer experience."
"This company is one of the BIGGEST CONS in the world - first they con us into buying their overpriced devices, then they con us into using all their software and services - taking Billions through subscriptions. They fraud their customers. shut down your account without notice, you ask for a refund or compensation for lost service - only company in the world that wont accept responsibility for their mistakes, actions and bad customer service! What a joke...Customer service agents in Phillipines - lets drive the cost of service down to pennies by employing people on the other side of the world who know zero about some of the issues that customers in UK markets face! They put up all forms of paywalls, barriers and other obstructions for you to get to them! They make it so easy for you to click subscribe...but so difficult for you to raise a dispute or to resolve one! You get all sorts of notifications about iOS upgrades - but ZERO to tell you when a trial - paid for subscription is about to charge you a whole year of subs. The bottom line is they lie and manipulate consumers...Their brand is the bitten Apple - go figure! amazing symbology and true to form! Lure you in and then take all you got...Im tired of this scam company and brand!!! When will it end..."
"This is the first time I've written a critical review but my situation with Apple is horrible. First off, I'm at fault for what happened, not blaming anyone else. My 6 year old grandson was buying some stuff for his games with an itunes card we had bought him. We completely forgot the account was tied in with my Visa (pre-authourized Apple TV payment). $2087cad in charges later and I called Apple support in a panic. The woman who helped (Leslie, she was amazing and sweet) said there wouldn't be an issue with refunds because it was obvious a child had made these purchases, but it could take up to a month. I waited and in the end got $195cad refunded. All the other charges didn't qualify for a refund. I appealed this decision and was turned down again. I called support back and they said they couldn't figure out why they weren't refunded so she asked a senior supervisor. That person  also agreed and couldn't figure it out either. I asked for them to contact the dept. that does the refunds but they are separate from customer service and they have no say. What is really horrible is that we have been long time Apple customers, spending thousands of dollars. Iphones, ipads, macbooks, Apple TV. I work in a customer based field and I've never refused a refund to one of my customers. Sometimes they order the wrong thing, mistakes happen. And I would understand if Apple was in financial difficulty but we all know they make a huge profit. With social media so prevalent, companies need to be aware that customers have a say now, and that can be detrimental to future sales. My family and I will no longer support this company. $1900cad is a drop in the bucket for Apple, but lost business from my family will be a lot more than that. If the public has issues with an Apple product or service and is not treated well by the company, what will happen with their future profits? Take care of your customers, it pays off in the future!!"
"Apple customer support is by far the worst ive ever had. Ive had issues with my apple ids for months. and i bought a brand new iphone 11 and it wont let me add any apps. i chat in with them and they say a senior advisor will email me, and then in TWO DAYS they email me to say they cant figure it out. Seriously, dont waste your money, buy a droid. Apple is the absolute worst."
"I am so fed up with apple they do not care about the customers i have a xr i bought brand new from the apple store so lately my battery has been diminishing so i asked if it can get it replaced they said yeah its covered im like okay cool waited an hour for an appointment just to be told that the battery has to be diminished more then what mine is so thanks for making me wait an hour to tell me that and really stop making the same bullsh** phones like it's getting ridiculous every year you expect something big but its the same sh** give up on the iphones man and bring the fingerprint back the face rec is garbage and with the corona you have to keep pulling your mask down puts you at risks i have been an apple fan since the iphone 4 and would never buy or use anything else but anymore its the same garbage phone for more money lets change the camera lets add another one lets take out the headphone jack lets move the camera and your ios is a joke its been damn near the same set up for ever now just give up apple your phones are garbage now"
"The WORST phone I have EVER had and don't even get me started on the service - I have had a broken phone since day one - the apple warranty stands for nothing - I have been in and out of apple appointments for 11 months and still they will not replace the phone - even though the apple so called genius also witnessed the fault as he had to call me back multiple times as we got disconnected they just want to keep trying to repair a phone that they cannot fix. As an NHS worker - who needs her phone to contact patients this is the WORST phone i've ever had - it disconnects whilst I am speaking to a patient. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - APPLE WILL NOT DO ANTHING"
"Imagine being that expensive and not providing earphones or a charger brick No innovationDesign is stale Company is a rip offI will be removing my cloud products and my next phone will be samsung"
"My mac book pro arrived on 6th August 2020. I started to work with it in september because in August i wa in holiday. from the beginning it has problems, when I hold the mac book or touch it body it creates small noises !!! I went to Authorized service in “Trieste” a city in italy that I live , they told me yes we checked and your  mac dostam have problem and it is  just minor voice !!! But my question is , I paid 2000€ for mac boom and all the time it creats small noises from its body and the company is not responsible !!!!! Very bad product and very bad customer service, apple even doesn’t have a Email to communicate!!! At least get your problematic product and give my money back !!!!!"
"Had a look at iphone 12 Pro Max as i was thinking to preorder it on 16th. In my surprise they wont provide anymore headsets and charger 😡 as an excuse of saving the environment (how many chargers we see laying around in streets harming the environment?! -none!). However the price of the phone is not reduced and also they mention that you can buy them separately. wattttt😫. I just skipped and now looking at competitors. Been using iphone for all my life but this new thing made me disgusted that i just have to give up on apple products."
"Customer service isn’t helpful and the products are not durable. They’re not covered under a useful warranty and apple care is such a rip off. Why not make products that last? I hate it here"
"I just received an Apple Watch series 6.  How disappointed I was to find they no longer include a wall adapter for the charge cord.  Their CSR said is was for environmental concerns, but we all know it's a way to save a buck.  If they are so proud of their contribution to the environment, why don't they make a BIG DEAL about not including the adapter up front when showing all the selling features?  At least make sure the customer is aware, instead of hiding that fact deep in the fine print?  Not cool, Apple."
"I was just on a call with apple because they have pushed my order back without permission and when i asked to make it the delivery type it was (Saturday delivery) i had specifically told them to tell me if anything might push the order back further and what did they do they pushed it back now i have gone a whole month without my Ipad pro which i am meant to have by the end of Sept. I now desperately need this device for 6th form and do not have it, and im getting sanctions after sanctions."
"I have the apple 8+ and I have had issues with calls being dropped and/or muted out during conversations since I bought it 7 months ago. I should have done my review research before buying it because many people have had this same issue. I paid for Apple Care but it only covers you with a refurbished phone, NOT a new phone that they say to sell you Apple Care. The camera isn't even that great and sound overall has static or echoed..  Iphones are never really great but Iphone8 is a BUM model and Apple Care doesn't offer anything other than ""repairing"" a refurbished phone."
"dont get me wrong, every apple employee i talked to had great customer service, however when youre told that your phone will go to the apple repair shop and be repaired and back in my hands for free in 6 days, that sounds like a good deal right? WRONG!!! its hard enough not having a phone, but you know whats even harder? having a job that requires you to have a phone, and working while its taken the phone somehow 3 weeks to be sent to the carrier and to be  diagnosed. now apple wants to charge me $99 to repair my phone that has faulty software from apples faulty updates. this is absolutely insane to have my phone gone for 4 weeks, have everyone beat around the bush, and then at the last minuet, bam!! straight for the pocket book, classic apple, always want my money for some reason. VERY unsatisfied with the product, could rate the iphone 11 and the B.S. apple put me through lower than one star if i could."
"Dresden, beautiful city in the east of Germany. But the apple store in Dresden altmarkt galerie is poisoed by horrible customer service. Someone should come and train them starting with the basics. If apple products were not so amazing I would switch to the competitor just for this reason."
"I didn’t even want to give one star. I am so tired of things being charged on my card. Everyday lately - I asked to cancel everything and take my card off - they can’t. I can’t take take it off either. WTH. Just remove my card!"
"Apple removed fortnite they are being petty over the whole situation and they over price there phones when they are crap and break super fast everyone that I know that has an iphone will be switching to Samsung including me shame on you apple your always after people's money"
"i bought the product on 5 th august its started with the defect software defects after a few days after one moth the screen broke i dont know how but it did. so i assumed that it was my fault so i paid also 55 thousand on top of it to replace it after it came after repairing sensors stoped working .i took it to the same service center again and they told me thell repair it till next day the next day they told me tht the speakers were defective theyll have to replace them and itll take one week for that so after one week they are telling me the whole logic board was replaced and the problem is still not solved .i called the apple support and told them my problem they told me  that yes they agree with me and they agreed that the product that they give me was defective and the product was new and THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE A NEW DEFECTIVE PIECE and the laptop is still with the service center one week they kept it with them to replace a the screen and now again its with them from 1 and a half week they started replacing one part after another now they have started replacing parts they have already replaced.APPLE SERVICE AND THEIR SERVICE HAVE LITERALLY GONE DOWN THE DRAIN .i am saying this after i bought there    flagship product if they dont repair it till the end of this weekend the only option left is to move to consumer court."
"The iphone 8p lasted 17 months then shut down while I was using it and would not restart.  None of the fix it steps worked nor did a new battery help.  Apple repair wants $399 to fix this type of problem.  My response - hello Motorola G Stylus for $250.  Will never buy any Apple product again."
"Had a great service with apple Genius Bar staff, my phone was sorted there and then without any problems.Thanks"
"I have purchased Apple products for decades. I'm not to old to learn another OS because service is AWFUL!!!"
"I'll never buy another Apple product again. My love for Macs has reached a crash and burn ending. Their customer service has become non-existent, they want YOU the customer who pays $1800 for a laptop to FIX your own problems, and I just bought a MacAir to replace my 6 year old MacAir and this one HAS NO USB PORTS. JUST STUPID! WHY??? And so I want to return it, and I've been in a bot-chat for 20 minutes. STILL NO RETURN LABEL. Apple sucks now, and it's a shame. I was a loyal customer for 20 years."
"Worse costumer service ever. I have been shopping online for many years but with apple it was my worse experience ever. They sent me back the returned products multiple time and I have to return it again. It has been two months since I bought an Iphone and returned it but still not only I haven’t received my over $1000 refund but also the issue hasn’t resolved yet. I will never ever buy any apple products again."
"Terrible customer service, won’t give refunds. Will never buy another Apple product again. Taking advantage of a child. Going to call BBB!!!"
"I have owned countless iphones (since the first model), 4 ipads, 4 macbooks, and an apple watch. I've never had a single one that did not need repair. The lastest problem...I just spent $3,117.56 of my hard earned dollars on a MacBook Pro. In JUNE. Not even 4 months later the thing is broken. Called support (I have the standard warranty, AND paid for the $300 apple care). Agent did not seem to know what to do to help. Agent just gave up after minimal effort and just assumed “it is a hardware issue and needs repair”Tried to set an appointment online, getting error message “We’re Sorry. We are unable to complete your request at this time.” For 2 days I am getting this message! Called tech support back. Spoke to Colby (senior advisor for Mac Teach Support). No desire to help resolve the issue. Talking over me. Dismissive attitude. (This type of poor service is typical…for a $3000 luxury product!) Only option is to send my computer in or go someplace that’s not apple for repair. I cannot get an appointment with apple for a 4 month old, $3000 computer with a $300 warranty. The outside companies LOST MY COMPUTER in the past (actually LOST my old Mac) so that’s never an option for me again. And WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC. Sending my computer in for a repair, and being without what’s now an essential life necessity for days or even weeks is also NOT AN OPTION. Save $2500 and get a regular old PC. Will work just about as well, and you won’t pay luxury prices for crappy products that are guaranteed to fail. Apple makes so much money, and the products have become ubiquitous so they no longer have to care much about service or quality."
"This is ridiculous. It doesn’t support many features, and is not worth the price. Whoever made it is clearly deluded."
"Apple were taking out fees for extra storage from a child's 2 bank accounts for the same phone when it should have only been the one account only noticed it when I got statements through and they say they will not be refunding it shocking"
"I like apple because it has been upgrading ever since, their cameras  is a lot more clear and live, the device gets faster and faster with processing , also it has a great battery unless you over use your phone."
"This is a battle between  Apple and Samsung.The Samung is making cheap parts for Apple and thereby more sales for Samsung.Apple phone parts detptriate its quality by day and won't funtion.money is lost after purchase of iphone 7.worked for less than year.The dealer told me get it repair at third party.The customer service says""To replace the iPhone 7 is almost the same as buying the new iPhone SE that recently came out.Replacement is different from buying.now the phone is not detecting the new hardware.neither it boots.Apple said sorry."
"Had a problem with wife’s Apple Watch after numerous Telephone calls to Apple and a visit to the so-called genius bar in my local Apple Store and speaking to too many to mention Apple experts my product was then sent away to some more experts who had it for a total of seven hours then returned it to myself saying it was fine as it was working at 80% which I said the watch was only three months old and I bought it to work at 100% spoke to another expert who then went through some diagnostics with me and said there was a problem with the battery and I had to monitor monitor it for 24 hours then would call me back I waited for his call when it came the my phone rang once and cut off tried to call back on the number and was told I was unable to do so still waiting for a callback. I am very disappointed in the Apple customer service which I think is absolutely disgraceful all my family have Apple products which we will never ever buy again. I always thought Apple were bigger than thisBut obviously I was wrong. People be aware when buying these products once they have your money their customer service doesn’t exist."
"During this crisis many companies have been able to ascend above it all and help those in need; But one company will never try to help anybody, even during this crisis. They will only cause more strife and issues for everyone during this disaster. It doesn't matter who you are, they hate everyone the same (but that's still a form of prejudice). That company is Apple!!!!! Apple has closed all of their stores down,in addition to their customer service is less than pathetic, and that's being generous. After talking to multiple ""customer service representatives"", they send an email for me to reply to, for an answer (that I might never receive), just for me to give the same information I already did multiple times.  How is that in anyway Customer Service? Everything that they're doing is making me hate that disrespectful company, that I previously gave thousands of my dollars for their products in the past. I never want to buy another Apple product of any kind. I guess it makes sense their entire system is anything but customer friendly and now ..... so are they. With all the hoops they make us jump through because they are incapable of lifting a finger to help anyone in need (besides stock holders and millionaire's). I have to say this much and I hope everybody else agrees, Apple does not deserve any of our business ever again. What we have to do is get rid of it, go to Android, go to Google, or anything else besides Apple, because they are the issue. They are trying to make this pandemic last so that don't have to do squat and still get our hard earned money (for some it seems to be less and less every day). Anyone .... Everyone... Just think about what companies have been there during this tribulation, if you have a brain and believe the same as me, close down every single Apple account you have, disconnect every phone and buy something besides these Satanic, Destructive and Cataclysmic Apple products. Let's get rid of the one pandemic we can. They only try to make what we are all going through, worse for everyone. We need to stop it before it spreads. Apple must die."
"I have the iPhone 8+ and I can say from the bottom of my heart I love this phone so much, there is no need to upgrade to anything more recent. The battery life is amazing and I love the plus sizedness of it, I love the 2 cameras and my favourite part of the whole phone is the home screen button!!!!! I love the button its so nice and I don't known why anyone would need one of those stupid phones without it. 10/10 would recommend"
"I never had problems with Apple. Great customer care and very helpful via live chat too."
"I have PAID for and downloaded music on my apple phones for years.  I subscribed to apple music and cancelled it.  Now I cannot access the music that I paid for.!  I called apple and they tell me I can pay a monthly fee for apple music then I can have access to my music!  This is FRAUD!  I purchased the music already!  I should not have to pay a monthly fee to access it!"
"They billed my debit card when I applied & was approved for their credit offer. when I called they said tough, we will initiate a refund, you ""might"" get your money back in a couple weeks.     Bottom line, APPLE BAD!"
"I decided this year that I needed an upgrade in technology both for personal and business use. I decided to go with apple because people claimed it was the best and it was the most expensive leading me to believe if people paid these prices it must be worth it. In the year 2020 I purchased a brand new MacBook Pro  and iPhone 11pro max.  I must say in all the years of using computers and cellular phones I have never had as many problems lost data and inability to fix these problems as I have in the past six months with Apple alone. Thousands of photos disappeared that were saved in a file on the MacBook Pro and that can never be replaced due to it being from a vacation to years prior that were placed in a specific folder and tagged. And now nobody can figure out what happened to them and nobody can seem to tell me how to get them back. You can Google 1 million things and none of them work and they take hours an hours for anybody to figure out even what half the time they’re talking about and Apple itself as far as support is completely an early useless. If you do not have a completely and utterly generic problem that they understand that they already have and put in a pre-recorded way to solve it you will never find an answer. Right now during COVID-19 their stores are basically closed down there is no way to get an actual person to help you and they deny having 90% of the problems that they actually have. Every day when I turn on the laptop more information is just gone. Every time they doing update more information that has been saved is permanently gone. And then their only response is basically to back it up to a cloud that you have to pay monthly membership fee towards. Which is ridiculous because I have not even utilized 5% of the total memory of either the data on the cellular phone or the laptop itself I should not require a cloud with a monthly membership fee for overage data when I have all of this space and I don’t want my information in a cloud I want it on the very expensive machines that I purchased. The reason I purchased these machines with all of this space is so I did not require information to be in a cloud it could be at my fingertips on the device itself.  It’s as if every single time they offer to sell me cloud space with a monthly fee and I say no they purposely delete more of my information and then proclaim it was because I don’t have cloud back up. I shouldn’t need cloud back up when I have 118 GB of space left. And all I’m trying to do is access 200 photos that were saved and in a file on the laptop. I made a horrible mistake of investing in three iPhones one for me and one for each of my children as well as this  expensive MacBook Pro.  Every day I think it’s going to get better and I spend hours of my life wasted away researching how to save in ensure things are saved on these devices into work with them and it is a waste of time because the next day I turn them on I try to do something in the information is gone again and I’m starting from scratch. People are purchasing the name Apple.  They are definitely not purchasing these devices for quality or ease-of-use they are buying it for the name alone in the logo as a status symbol. Me being my age have absolutely no interest in either of these things and wanted quality. It is unfortunate that this brand gets this morning rave reviews despite it having  such poor quality and poor performance.  My 19yo son with is majoring in computer engineering and my 16yo daughter who is completely tech obsessed have both admitted over the last 6months that apple appears to have no concern or intent on fixing it’s problems and design flaws, it is too preoccupied with putting out a newer version and charging even more money. With the newer version they can claim they have fix the problems in millions of people of already purchased them before they realize they have not. And it does not appear like they have any interest or intent on fixing previous versions to where they function and are useful for even general use. The largest tragedy aside from lost business and not meeting deadlines due to missing information on the MacBook was losing an entire folder full of photos from my vacation two years ago.  These photos have been in this file for the past 5 1/2 months I have looked through them with the intent of making an album for my mother as me and my two children and my parents have gone on a two week cruise and vacation. After my father passed away from COVID-19 I today went to put together an album and realized everything is gone. Attempted for multiple hours to figure out from Apple or from anybody how to get theme back or how to find them and apparently I will never see them Because I made the horrible mistake six months ago of transferring all of my stuff into Apple’s hands."
"I only give it 1 star because that’s the only way I can leave this review - don’t take your phone to these people. We had an issue with a phone so their idea - without asking us - was to reset the phone. All data was lost with no backup- it was unnecessary.  These people are not technical or they’re very uncaring about other people. Personal data should be very important to Apple but apparently it is not."
"Will never buy another apple product again, ever the customer service has taken a different direction from the way it was when it was Apple I hate bad reviews especially writing one but man oh man Apple sucks It’s been 12 days and I’m waiting on an air pod under warranty The phone customer service tells me that it’s an exchange item go to the store and it’s a different story because the Genius Bar is waiting for the part I regret buying my 11 Max Pro and guarantee my next tablet or phone will be a Samsung I’ll just deal with Best Buy instead are least they care about their customers or having a 1 star rating what a disgrace"
"Diabolical treatment of customers. I’ve bought apple products since 2008. Have had over €3000 worth of products fail in the last 14 months to be basically told “tough” by apple."
"Bought an i pad from the Apple store only for it to stop working 3 months later . Their customer care is absolutely horrendous I have been onto them now 6 times only for them to discover there is 2 serial numbers attached to the product . Whats their solution.  Send it back to me so I can then resend it to them !!!!!!!?. Anyway 3 weeks later still not fixed and I'm loosing business because of it . Disgraceful"
"I have a iPad 6th gen and i just updated it. It just stopped working after a while! I can't do my classes or anything. And when I tried to download the update that would fix it, it said it couldn't do it! Now I can't do my classes or play anything on it without it kicking me out or turning off!Please fix this!"
"Accidentally cancelled Apple care and tried to call immediately and fix but they weren’t open at the time so waiting until they opened and called when they opened and they basically just say I’m out of luck.. From now on shop android, especially if you would like to be talked to like an actual person!"
"Apple id lost,can't activate,I don't know what for it made it is,other mobiles can be unlocked. Being a original owner not able to trace out to come out of this nonsense."
"5gb of free space available gallery doesn’t save videos"
"Got a new IPhone SE, and applied to trade my old phone in which had very few problems, love the new iPhone it’s perfect but never received my money for my old phone and they send it back so many times for me to change something then send it back and when I did it they said I was past my date. Spend hours on hold with Apple and they didn’t help at all."
"Forget password, passcode, apps, and cloud iusse are wasting customers time with important issues like myself! Apple needs to design a phone and department for challenge people with simple issues!!"
"Apple customer service is definitely lacking.  I purchased an Apple Watch 6 with sports loop.  I called customer service because number 1 the sport loop does not detach from watch easily.  Number 2 it is very uncomfortable on my wrist.  I was told I need to send back watch and band, to get a replacement band.  This would mean no Apple Watch for almost a month to complete transactions.  I ended up buying another original sport band on Amazon. This is not how customer loyalty is built."
"Phone is very nice but charger-cable  is very bad , please change metal easy to rest, Always need to changing charger cable..Apple always giving quality product but charger cable always problem.."
"I recently ordered an iPhone 11. During the order process I indicated that I had an old phone to trade in. It's hard to ""miss"" this step. The website said they would send a trade in kit and I would get $70 credited to my order when I returned it.I never received the kit and when I inquired with Apple they said my order didn't show that I requested a trade in and all they could do for me was a $50 Apple gc with a standalone trade in. The customer service person said there was no way to give me the $70 credit. NOT HAPPY"
"I have recently purchased a MacBook Air 2020 from Apple  Store in Mall of the Emirates Dubai. The customer service at Apple store Mall of the Emirates is non existent. I was informed I will get 12 months free tv which turned out to a blatant lie. There was a problem with my product I took it back for someone to take a look and advise me of the problem to which I was informed we don’t have anyone available because of pandemic to advise me😂 yet it’s ok for you to have everyone available to sell the damn products. I will not recommend Apple Store  at Mall of the Emirates to anyone. Just be careful of the pack of lies you’ll be told in order to sell their undesirable products. Apple Store at Dubai Mall have far better customer service.Goodbye 🍎 Hello Samsung.Samsung products are looking nicer with an enviable customer service as well as after sales  Support."
"We have been loyal apple users since the beginning. We only buy apple devices. That is likely to change on principal. I have bought 4 new qualified devices from apple in the past year. Each time they tell you your device comes with a free year of Apple TV plus. That is a lie! It was never offered. Apparently at some point someone on my Family share plan use a 3 month trial earlier this year. Which was cancelled when it ran out. We have bought 2 new iPhones since then and never got the free year. After contacting customer support and dealing with Kayla for an hour and a half and sending in receipts showing my purchase was only a month and a half ago, she told me that my free trial had to be claimed with in the first 3 months. I asked her to look at the date on the receipt. She said yes I see you are well within the 3 month window but I still can't help you. What a joke! Apple is not living up to their promises. Samsung is starting to look pretty good!"
"NEVER ORDER THROUGH APPLE AGAIN! WE ORDERED TWO ITEMS WHICH WERE SHIPPED THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT CARRIERS AND ARRIVED AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES. FEDEX, ONE OF THE SHIPPING CARRIERS, WERE SO CARELESS WHEN THEY DELIVERED OUR PACKAGE THEY SIGNED FOR US AND DROPPED THE PACKAGE OFF AT THE BACK DOOR OF A US POST OFFICE, WHICH WAS THE DELIVERY ADDRESS. THE PACKAGE WAS STOLEN! APPLE DID NOTHING, JUST CLOSED THE CASE WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO TRACK THE PRODUCT. THEY CLAIM THEY WILL WORK WITH POLICE. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. APPLE IS NOW UNPROFESSIONAL AND THEY HIRE UNPROFESSIONALS    WIFEOFGOD"
"Tried to return an item so that I can get a new laptop for uni , and the return process took 3 weeks. I called 5 times and the number of errors and delays they said they were experiencing were astonishing."
"My wife ordered apple airpods for our daughter’s birthday and the package arrived empty!!! Yes EMPTY! Now dealing with their extremely unprofessional customer service trying to get a replacement product and they want to do an investigation and all other ignorance! They won’t do a refund or ship replacement! Apple you suck! Having never dealt with you before I am tempted to go back to Samsung where at least I know I have a quality product and customer service! All of your outsourcing to Vietnam, Korea, Tawain and who knows where else has degraded your quality control and this is extremely unacceptable! I will make this complaint go viral on every social media platform available to me. You are a completely pathetic company! After researching online, it appears that this type of incident occurs constantly! We are done with Apple and again I have a large number of friends and will make this go global!"
"Dear customers, beware Apple have been ripping people off for years and now they are getting even worse!My problems arose when I requested for the Apple I.D to be removed from my own refurbished handset which was sent to me by my mobile phone insurance provider.After NINE months of going back and forth with Apple Customer 'Support' they have repeatedly asked for a proof of purchase for a refurbished handset which I received in 2018.  Had I not used the apple iPhone for downloading iTunes and apps I would understand but it seems that they are very desperate to force people to stick with their products even when they can no longer be used properly.  I understand why now, it's because their device sales have dropped consistently year after year.  Samsung and Huawei make magnificently better devices at cheaper prices.You have been warned people.  Avoid Apple products at all costs."
"I purchased an iPhone 11 Pro, which is supposedly water resistant and was happy with my purchase. It got splashed laying on the ground near our paddling pool and started playing up, after sending it off and the phone being sent back with absolutely no information I got an appointment to visit them in the store and have somebody look at the phone. They deemed the phone water damaged and there is nothing they could do, even though it was only 3 months old. They did however offer me another phone at 10% off which didn’t really help seeing as I’d already paid big money for the phone in the first place."
"I brought a pair of AirPods from Apple this time last year I had to get a new pair sent to me because I could no longer hear sound out of them, they lasted until 1 month ago where I couldn’t hear the sound out of them again so this is the second pair of AirPods I’ve had in less than a year!! I then talk to them for the last 3 weeks speaking to about 8 different people all promising me they will give me a paid upgrade and will email me or call me the following day... they never called me so I called again today to find out that my upgrade hasn’t been approved and they never told me when they found this out... I have been waiting for 3 weeks to get sent a new product because of their 2 fault products and they never even told me they won’t send me it"
"My 2019 iMac is very, very slow. Not worth the price. Really frustrated and disappointed. All AppleCare can do for me is suggest that I buy more RAM, which I have to take it to the store to do. Incredibly disappointing. I guess I just expected more."
"Scammed by Apple .Purchased an app and it does not work , contacted customer service to ask for a refund ant the refund was refused without any reason and when I asked what was the reason I did not get an answer just been stayed that there is no more information that they can provide about the case as  iTunes closed the case , so my conclusion is that if someone has a bad day you don’t get your refund.So I can say that I have been Scammed by Apple  so don’t buy apps  from Apple store unless you know you will use that app forever as you will not get your money back if the app is not working you get Scammed by APPLE  I have emails and screenshots to prove that my review is genuine ."
"What wrong with Apple service. I use Apple since 1992, i never get any problem about the warranty service. Early, i buy Airpod Pro on 16 Mars 2020, after 6 month, my ear right not work anymore without any reason. I go to iCare Service in Bangkok to check what is the problem. After 1 week, iCare contact me to pay $108 to change my case box because they find some liquid inside. Where this liquid come from ? i never drop down my case box in water or anything else. What about my warranty !!! They say, this problem is not under warranty. I understand, but if i do something wrong, i will pay, that's not a problem, even if my warranty is expire, i can pay. But on this problem, what you are doing Apple !!! Are you joke or... You have my ID, so feel free to contact me to solve my problem quick as possible. This product is already expensive, so get Airpod Pro for $450, are you kidding ? I would like just my Airpod Pro work ! This is my first review and i'm not done with the review. Waiting for you answer. Thanks to consider your customers"
"Customer service is a joke.  I was supposed to be refunded 75 dollars never received it back trying to order a replacement ear pod for my daughter. Had insurance.  We were on hold and transferred to several times for 50 minutes.  Never have these problems with my android.  SMDH. Pay all this money for an iPhone and get really bad customer service."
"It's disappointing how low standards have dropped over the last 7 years, and is no doubt a symptom of poor leadership and lack of accountability. There are certainly some highly intelligent, capable and well meaning people working for Apple, but this is outweighed by the quantity of moronic and incapable. It is now more of a fashion show than it is a genuine desire to design and deliver the very best tools. The new MacBook 16"" has two major issues. One of these is the battery. I have a top spec model with 32GB Ram, 8GB GFX Card and i9 processor. Of course, this is going to use more power! What I have noticed though is when running certain programs that the battery will drain faster than it can charge. This seems totally daft. I would rather have a heavier, larger machine that can actually support its spec. These day's it's all about having the thinnest and sexiest looking tech and people care less and less for practicality and performance (as for most people who are not power users or do not rely on these tools to make a living, won't notice).The battery life when taken off mains power is also considerably less than that of my 2013 MacBook Pro 15"" which is still running like a train. It’s appalling really. I was advised that this is due to using programs that activate the GPU (like Google Chrome). The Apple store assistants response was ""it will be because of the i9 processor and will say in the small print somewhere"". Are you kidding me? The biggest issue is the screen. Which isn't surprising, as I had two replacements on my last MacBook. This one however won't reach the advertised brightness of 500 Nits, and the colour is off. This has been confirmed by Apple, who have offered a replacement.Only, there would be a minimum of a 1 week turnaround to repair what I work on every day. Great, good job I have one of their 5K LG 27"" monitors (which works perfectly). If I didn't have this, I'd have flipped my lid! The main reason I buy Apple products is for the quality of their screens, as I work in design.When I went into the shop to get it booked in (before finding out about the 1 week turnaround), the same assistant added to the case notes that ""he was unable to observe the issue"" with the screen. So much for the hours that I spent diagnosing it, getting support and an engineer over the phone to take a proper look. You don't have to look far through Google to see that both of these issues are quite prevalent with this model.Neither am I surprised to read other reviews about iPads bending.QA (quality assessment) has clearly gone down the toilet, and in-store employees are pretentious know-it-alls who can't comprehend that you might actually know something. Which isn't a surprise either, as it seems there's a trend forming between buying Apple products and a lower IQ.All that said, when can I get the iPhone 12?"
"Siri needs fixed. I try to use it but it will not listen at all.Also apple’s products are WAY to expensive. The iPhone 11 is $700 and it’s huge. To big it needs to be smaller. It can’t fit in to your pockets since it’s like 9x5."
"Don’t trust Apple. Okay now I never thought I would say that or be in this situation but, Apple is a waist of time and a joke. We have countless Apple products in the house and one of them belongs to my girl friend. She is a well known illustrator and for her work uses the new iPad Pro with all the extras coming on at over £1500. Don’t get me wrong, the price of a product dose not mean it should or should not be taken seriously. She has had this iPad Pro for 2 months and......, it has bent! Yes I said bent. This iPad never leaves her desk in the office. So it stays on a flat surface at all times. Apple have said that this is a normal thing that happens with this product, in fact some people are opening the box to find its bent straight out of the box. Who the hell is in charge of Apple quality control. If this was a car company, or any other. This would be placed on recall for the item to be fixed. After all it’s not to say Apple are short of money, they have just exceeded 2 trillion in worth. That’s more than Englands national debts. The problem is with the The devices that have a cellular capability, the aerial is wrapped around the side of the iPad, thus making it week and flimsy. Oddly none on display in any shops I’ve check are bent. That to me is mis selling a product and as it’s known by Apple but not told to the buyers is also mis-selling and must fall under the Trades Description Act. On all phone calls and face to face contact with Apple they are not taking any responsibility. In one case the rep hung up the phone. I do not think that we, or anybody else should be paying for this to be rectified as it’s not the customers fault. It’s a known fault of the manufacture and more than that, they don’t tell you about the fault. So why do Apple get away with all of this. We are not the first and I’m sure we can remember the iPhone 6 that also had a similar problem. That was never solved. It’s wrong that the consumer protection bodies let Apple get away with this and are not protecting the consumer. VW got hit hard for the dirty engine that didn’t meet the standards it said it should so how and why is Apple, the most expensive in America aloud to get away with this. The concept of the iPad has now gone obviously as the excitement, inspiration and creativity of an artist is diminishing due to the fact the tool she has to use is not even flat....The funny thing is I’ve just found out that mostly all of the components that make the new iPad Pro are not made by Apple, guess what is..? Yes that’s correct, it’s the frame. So you had one job to do and you couldn’t even do that properly.  Apple you have waisted people’s time money and trust in your products and your after care is awful. The worst company I’ve ever put trust in."
"Updated my phone to IOS 14 and I’ll tell you somet it’s f*cked my phone up big time. U better get it sorted. It won’t let me use any of my cameras on my phone and it’s just a shi*e updated tbh. I’m ashamed"
"Apple is a joke big time I bought a bundle for a game for my son and it say item error I tried 3 time and it said item error second time on the third try I got the item but got charged two times when I got the error and they would not refund me the money back I got a error on £1.99 & £0.99 and two £4.99 this is the first time I called and complaint and they will not help me or do anything to help me at all and I have spent £1800 online they trying to call me a liar I have been with apple from day one after this I’m moving to Android"
"I bought it back in 2018, got it for an affordable price. Works Great! Highly recommend any android users to switch."
"I was never in Gestapo Germany but the Escondido, CA Apple store has that feel.  High covid security, ""raise your mask higher, stand here, move here, get in that line,"" and worse.  Then they didn't approve my mask as though there was federal law about materials and said I must use their masks.  Fine, but the man who brought it used his bare hands holding the cloth in the middle as though I'd be happy to wear a mask with whatever he has touched in the last 4 hours.  Then their staff takes my phone and computer and without wiping it or themselves, works on it and scrolls at will.  It's given back the same way...without being wiped.  Sorry, but if you want to play the heavy rules, then play by them yourselves.  Additionally you will find that the largest computer wizards in the world have an on line appointment system that can take an hour to process.  Seriously?  Then try to change that appt.....another hour.  If you have a complete staff layoff then why isn't online service available instantly?  Why does it say due to covid we are going to be another hour?  You're the leader in the industry and you haven't gotten it going.  When Walmart and Home Depot have outdone you, you better worry.  My advice, don't buy new Apple products until they open and become NICE again.  Too big for your britches is not a good look."
"I have Been with Apple for a long time and spent quite a lot of money with them in the last yr itself I brought a new iPhone XR and it’s needed to be sent of to repair and Apple Manage to lose in transaction on return back to me and now they are refusing to send a replacement or refund me even though I have sent all the necessary details like the invoice And IME number.I would buying from them based on their service."
"3 Stars as they are normally really nice but today I got a pretty crappy customer service rep. Not what I expect of Apple."
"Glass of iPod cracked while laying on a desk,Well of course Apple says, Well you must have done this and is outside of Warrany,FRACK YOU APPLEDO NOT BUY APPLE PRODUCTS"
"I have always used apple products.  I recently let my apple music die and today went to add funds to my account, I forgot my password and Apple locked my account up. The customer service can do nothing for me and I have to wait an entire day before I can download any apps, add funds to my account, or use apple music. I am sick of apple."
"USELESS Apple Batter /Insurance after one year, your battery life dies to 50%. Their customer service is not helpful. They don't want to change the battery, I have Apple Care (warranty) for many years and is Useless they won't do anything but blame it on your storage space ""saying you don't have enough storage space"" that is why the battery is not working right or and any thing they can blame. I REPEAT THEY WON'T REPAIR IT BUT TRY TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE  STORAGE SPACE. WARING DON'T BUY APPLE PHONE 6 or 7. They will make it hard on you to try and get your device fix through their company repair service. THEN THEY GIVE YOU THE DROP CALLS."
"I purchased a new Iphone 11 pro and the earphones didn't work.  Att, where I bought the phone, said I had to call Apple to resolve my problem.  The Apple rep I talked to got impatient when I couldn't find my password to download ""teamviewer"" and called my husband an idiot for trying to help me and hung up on me.  I called back and the next person I talked to was nicer but told me there weren't any earphones available.  He said he could send me the latest airpods instead for free, but I had to put a $100 deposit down which would be refunded.  He said I needed to use an Apple card which I didn't have. He told me to go to the nearest store and get a card.  He said he would stay on the phone while I drove to the store, but I couldn't leave right away.  He gave me a direct line and his ID number.  I called once I got to the store but the number was not available.  I tried several times but the number continued to be ""not available"".  I called the main Apple number and was put on a long hold.  So I gave up.  Earphones are included in the package with my new $1000 Iphone package-all I wanted replacement earphones that worked.  Apple--what happened?  You used to be so good.  What awful customer service."
"I have always purchased Apple products and I will no longer be doing that! I just got off the phone with costumer service because I can not redeem my free tv for one year promo offer.  They basically informed me since I redeemed a 7 day trail I am no longer eligible to get the free year! Lol that’s a load or bull. I spent the money and got a new iPad and can’t even get the free tv. They have lost a costumer."
"I just called the Washington Square Mall trying to find out how much it would cost to get a battery replaced in a ipod touch.  After asking me all kinds of questions he transfers me and the gal he transfers me to doesn't know why he transferred me to her as she can't answer my question.  She then transfers me again to who knows where and he wants to ask me all kinds of questions all over again to start a case.  I just wanted to know how much it would cost for a battery replacement.  You shouldn't have to start a case to answer what should be a simple question.  Now I'm off to find out what non apple device I can put music on."
"Do not every buy Apple unless you have enough money to keep buying new phones every few year for tons of money and do not care about reliability. After only 2 and a half years of owning a phone and may I mention I never dropped it on land or in water and they told me on the phone before the session that if it was not my fault they would cover it. Then after they examine the phone they tell me it would be $250 to get a new phone of the same model or more to upgrade and that this one was busted. So I leave and use a temporary trac phone I had lying around and its not good but manageable. I sell the old phone to someone who will use it for parts on another phone of the same model with a broken screen and they are telling me they fixed it but Apple said it couldn't be fixed. I hope they go bankrupt because there product suck!!!!!!! With out a doubt I am going to get an android phone now cause even if they do not last longer they are not as expensive as this piece of junk from a piece of junk company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Zero star will be generous. Warranty loophole issues just after wifi and bluetooth greyed out phone will be totally be swapped even though its their hardware issue. Iphone 8 plus trade in and will still pay £320+. Phone is 3-4 yrs old you robbers dressed in  disguise. Will never trust this product again. Wish they just go bancrupt."
"I sent my son's iPad off for repair under warranty after owning for 10 months. The battery lasts less than 30minutes on a full charge and drops rapidly. I thought this would be a simple fix for Apple. However, after inspecting the iPad for damage before sending and not finding any, I find Apple wish to charge me over £200 to fix the screen which is now broken. I have no proof it wasn't broke before sending (not sure how this would be possible) and they are refusing to repair the battery without replacing the screen 1st. I have email Mr Rogers on numerous occasions but he fails to answer the last person I spoke with just kept talking over me and despite me trying to make a formal complaint they simply keep allowing the rude and ignorant person to keep responding on their behalf. I simply want my sons iPad fixing under warranty and for them to stop using any loopholes in their warranty t&c to get out of repairing this."
"Once again Apple software seems to have been ""improved"" and is now less user friendly.  The latest version of Safari (14.0) no longer has top sites available.  You have to type in your site to access that page.  Bad move!"
"After only 30 mins trying to set up an iphone xr i can honestly say i never want another apple product ever again. As for apple as a company they couldnt be less intrested"
"IPhone 7 Plus, terrible Lightning Connector Durability, a $12.00 part takes down an otherwise good $700.00 cell phone???  Apple quality and durability are headed south"
"Terrible customer service.Iphone SE 3 months old and it keeps turning itself off. Stays off for 36 hours approx and then comes back on. I get about 24 hours out of it before it does the same again!Customer support has not helped at all. Spoken 5 times to them and they say nothing can be done whilst I'm travelling. I need to return to the UK as there are different laws there. I could make an expensive 3 hour journey to Munich but if the phone is on at the time, it won't show that anything is wrong. I've already been through this with a smaller 'apple authorised dealer' - which was the biggest waste of time. They don't know anything either and can't make any decisions without speaking to Apple! I'm going in circles! I'm not sure what apple support is... the only thing they all agree on is the first step is to turn the phone off and on again... useless."
"MacBook Pro 15” purchased new in April 2019 for over $3,500 AUD. Not yet 18 months old and lightly used the screen has developed a fault showing all dark areas in hues or light green and turquoise. Apple service dealer wants over $1,000 to replace the screen. Off to buy a Lenovo for less than repair. Goodbye Apple."
"Worst service, no clue what they are doing I was told I can redeem all the gift cards now I m told I can’t The whole stores sucks and they should do something or else we will change our products to other most competitive companies like Samsung and LG their prices and qualities are best then the iPhone and iPad"
"Huge que with no seats for anyone with disabilities if you make people stand outside great but not everyone can stand for an hour"
"I had the misfortune to visit the Manchester store this week ! The ridiculous restrictions in place before you can get in is far and away beyond reasonable and judging by and empty store and most of the staff hanging around outside the door others must feel the same. You’d have less hassle walking into a hospital ward !Utter madness"
"Very surprised to see the replacement shipped/ arrived next day. case #101187332416Priceless. Thank you."
"BULL st, ALL OF THE SUDDEN BOTH MY IPHONE 6S AND XS BATTERY DEGRADED TO  PERFORMANCE WHEN THERE IS REQUESTS COMING IN ABOUT IOS 14 UPGRADETHEY DRAINED BATTERY'S THESE F.krs  NO MORE APPLE FRUIT PHONES . had to choose one star because there is no option,.... big time money"
"Should have an option for zero stars-Had an issue with my IPhone XS Max, long story short-Must of spoken to at least 20 advisors, I was  trying to rectify an issue I had with the handset and a U.K. store. Eventually someone actually bothered to listen and took responsibility over the issue, offered to replace the handset free of charge- Received a phone call two days later basically saying that they were wrong to say they would replace it and I would have to buy a new one? I was then requested to send a letter, not an email but a letter to Cork (Ireland) for someone to look into the debacle. This was sent with a detailed breakdown of all the calls, emails that I had sent, roughly a page and a half. I received after chasing their so called CS department a one paragraph reply stating’ we cannot help’ After speaking them again Apple stated that they had closed the complaint, so after hours and hours getting pulled pillar to post, lied to, empty offers, Apple deemed there response to be professional and had looked into the complaint throughly.I have always used Apple products, on the whole have never had a problem, I really can’t fault the product until this instance. Shocking customer services and basically a non-existent complaints procedure."
"I’m sorry, I’ve been using Apple for 10 years, never had a problem until the last two to three years! I literally just brought a phone 6 months ago and the phone stayed frozen on the Apple logo. Okay contacted Apple and they sent me a replacement phone but now! I can’t even get into the phone because I forgot my Apple password which was in the phone that froze! I have 20 different passwords for my accounts for the reason being security. And now they are making me wait weeks to send me verification! I understand the policy of security but come on are you guys serious? People need their phones, they pay for the service and need the phone for work I depend on it. I’ll be considering other options once this contract is up and about to put the MacBook for sale if this continues."
"DO NOT BUY APPLE! They blocked my apple I'd and I can't reset unless I have another device that associated with my apple I'd. Bottom line if you don't have minimum of 2 devices you can't reset your password. If you can't reset you canf updateyour phone! If you can't update your phone the mafia doesn't let you use your apps! Why do we need these smartphones? Just make our lives so much harder!!! They also got class action lawsuit because they are sending you bugs during the update period to make your phone slower so youre forced to buy a new phone- Do not buy, boycott!!!!!"
"This is a copy of my initial questions to Apple Support, plus my Review, to show the total disrespect Apple have for their customers.   What has happened to Bookmark Top Sites.  It had important items on it all of which I cannot remember which is why they were there?    Start Page is useless you cannot add to it.   Why were we not notified of changes before they occurred?   You have completely spoilt my Apple pleasure which means I have wasted thousands of pounds.   Firstly you should not have removed Safari Top Sites without notification first.   That shows total disrespect for customers.   We went round and round the houses and got nowhere.   In the end a tech chap rang me but  still getting nowhere.  In the end needed to go and research and I needed a break after  a total of well over 2 hours.   I feel that not only have I wasted nearly £3,000 but by these actions Apple show absolutely no respect for customers.   Apple have caused me to lose some very important details which a back up would not have saved as the facility (Top Sites) is no longer in existence.  The tech chap promised to phone around 16:30 or after he finished with any assistance he was giving.   It is now 17:40+ and no call.   We were going to purchase an Apple phone for my wife but after this disrespect she now wants a Samsung."
"Have had my macbook pro for 3.5 years now. The keys started to get sticky so I took it into the genius bar for inspection. I was a bit worried that they would refuse to do anything about it as I had dropped the laptop in the past which left a huge dent in the body. However they told me that the keys could be repaired free of charge.4 days later I got the laptop back through the post and to my surprise not only the whole keyboard has been replaced with a new one, but also the mouse pad, the battery and whole top body are also completely new! I no longer have to look at that huge dent from where I dropped it :)It feels like a brand new laptop. Thanks so much apple! You have extended the life of this machine for another 5 years at least :)I would not call this an expensive product once you take into consideration its lifespan and good support."
"Literally my favourite brand but a bit too expensive."
"I had powerbeats 3 for less then 3 months and the ear piece fell out of the ear bud. I was assured this would be fixed for free since they have a year warranty but obviously after sending the product back to Apple they quoted me at $135 plus tax to get my product fixed. Essentially they were offering me brand new headphones. I also found out that specifically the ear hooks use to be covered for powerbeats 2 but because it was such a huge issue they changed that for powerbeats 3. This company is actually ridiculous and will never be getting a single dime from me again."
"... so arrogant, naive and unprofessional."
"What has happened to Apple support?!?! It’s disgusting how they’re treating customers now. The people on the front lines are unbelievably uninformed, arrogant and horribly unprofessional. I had an issue with a product that for some reason hadn’t shipped in five weeks. I called trying to find out what happened to the item. When they couldn’t figure it out, they just hung up! Three different times! Nisha, Kamry, Javier all fumbled around without addressing my issue and then hung up. Incredible. I would have thought i had called some small, fledgling company trying to work out its growing pains. Ha. Step it up APPLE! God knows we spend enough money with you."
"I’m thankful of Apple... they fill my most hated company slot. They do not care about their customers, just themselves. I truly hope someone who actually cares about their customers gains power in Apple, but it is so unlikely since that goes against everything they currently do. Privacy infringement, misleading their customers, and monopolistic actions are just 3 reasons I recommend avoiding the Apple company."
"I have an Apple watch which I bought in 2017. The face of the watch has lifted and I went online and noted that the Series 2 has a problem with a swelling battery which then lifts the face.  I went into the Apple store in Manchester to be informed the following:1. Apple watches only last 2 years and as I bought mine in April 2017 I should not be surprised that this has happened!2. I could be sent off for 'repair' but they don't repair so would be advised that I could buy a replacement Seriew 2 for £209.3. I was further advised that the price of a Series 3 was £197.I was to say the least shocked to learn that the Apple watch has a life of 2 years and I can by the old model as a 'replacement' which comes in higher than the Series 3.Needless to say I will not be buying another Apple watch - will return to a more conventional watch that has a longer shelf life and much better customer service. My Fossil watch was repaired 4 years after purchase for free""!Not sure how Apple will maintain its market share with such poor customer service and such shocking sustainability credentials - 2 year shelf life!!"
"So irritated by how they misinform with their promotion and everything, I just purchased and made a payment for an iPad over the phone and confirmed the amount, and a day after picking it up I saw another charge on my account but they refused to give me a refund saying I would have to return it and make a new purchase to get rid of the new charge, which doesn’t make sense at all."
"Apple won't replace my Mac Pro I bought that hasn't worked since day one. It's now been since July 10th... and I'm still getting the runaround. At this point I just want it gone and I want a refund but 10K out the door is what its looking like... Thanks, Apple."
"Apple rejected my refund request when i asked for a refund for several unauthorized purchases that were being made by someone who hacked into my apple account. Apple dont care about their customers and they are a greedy company who only cares about themselves. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY !!! The workers there are horrible and they dont seem to do their job properly. Apple is a scammer. Their company needs to shut down for stealing my money!!!"
"I am being charged for something my children (mind you LITTLE children) had done. They downloaded Christmas songs ect OVER 20 YRS AGO. Tried explaining to your costumer service but she said all well. Ya it doesn't matter you have to pay for it.  This is the biggest reason I will not BUY,SUBSCRIBE OR ANYTHING THING ELSE to this company.  Its not about the people that line your pockets with money, its only about money to you. I absolutely HATE DESPISE APPLE"
"Here is the type of thing Apple do to you loyal customers since launching the iPods and Mobiles I have bought all things apple and have like everyone had issues with the products user error or dropping phone also glitches etc but anyway that said I bought an series 4 watch ordered July last year received the month of August 26th works fine never used everyday but often for the duration other morning take it off charge doesn’t switch on only the time and lightening symbol appears thought o must not have had it on charge correctly tried another charger couple of hours still nothing takes it to Apple to look at tech guy loosing using the term Tech tried everything I had tried then goes away and returns and says never seen this issue and nothing on the trouble shooting guide it must be a battery fault duh no sh!t Sherlock 🕵️‍♂️ proceeds to tell me £75 to investigate the issue if it turns out the battery is faulty could be another £300 to repair I’m like when was the warranty finished 10 days ago so can’t do a warranty repair bearing in mind this is a £900 stainless steel watch and not a full year of usage and it’s failed surely this is a warranty repair as goods aren’t fit for purpose I bought £22 Casio that’s been ok for 12yrs go figure that out shocked at the response of the guy has it been in water 💦 eh it’s a waterproof watch ? Tech guy my rear end reading from a script and then told me claim from my insurance great Job Apple!!! SAMSUNG here I come."
"Apple is one pathethic company with a horrible customer service in india. I pur hased an Apple xr device from aptronix store at kharkana, hyderabad, india in 2018. I went to a beach and a spill of water on my XR device. That's it my 80k went into beach mud. I took it to apple authorised service center aptronix located at Secunderabad. These people were a bunch of douchebags. They took my device inside and messed up the screw of the device. Later they come and tell me that one of the screws of the device is stripped by a third party and we would not open the device. Which was bullcrap. I told them why would I go to a third party service provider if the phone was brand new and under warranty. I was helpless I persistently followed up with the apple customer support. They are even worse in india and the US support as well. Everyone in the customer support say they are manager but would not solve an bit of your problem. They follow their script no matter what. After my horrible experience I would suggest not to buy any apple products as they are overpriced and prone to damage easily and later you will struggle to follow up with their pathetic customer support. My device is still lying at home useless and my hard earned money gone in vain."
"Absolutely awful!! Purchased a MacBook in April 2018 and it has been 2 years and they have just diagnosed my MacBook with Logic board failure which costs £420.54 to fix!! And they stated that because there are two boards, replacing one may not fix it; Disgusting that it is a completely internal issue and no fault of my own and they will not cover the cost! Very disappointed"
"The reason i never trust apple is cause they lack the water resistance a think pad had in 2005, They practice no accountability for putting anti competitive fail safes in place to prevent anybody reasonably maintaining any of their products. It takes 5 minutes of research to know that this company is criminal and should be illegal."
"SO HELPFUL!!!!I had a problem with my settings and an Apple gift card and the employee was so helpful his name was Sam, I feel so bad that I can not remember the over helpful employers name before sam. But now it is all fixed!!! So happy 😁"
"Worst customer service ever and taking Advantage of customers during a pandemic they should be ashamed. My issue cannot be resolved around my work schedule as their stores are closed and mail in service requires you to be without a phone for up to 2 weeks to paying a whopping $600-$1200 deposit for another phone while yours is repaired. My iPhone 11pro max is a hunk of junk and the last apple product that I or my household purchases."
"F***ing joke of a company. I've never been able to make a purchase without an issue that takes 3 hours to fix. I always have to have a credit card in even if I have iTunes money. Customer service doesn't exist. This company is all about the money and nothing else. Honestly ever since Jobs died this company has been nothing but a s***hole."
"FU*** apple. Me and my friends play fortnite(THE GAME THAT F***N APPLE BAN) and my cousin cant play with me, lost is $800 account and the reason apple ban Fortnite is because apple would always take %30 of Fortnite’s VBucks money and fortnite blocked that. But how is apple not fine with that? Millions of games out there give money to apple, apple is rich. They need even more money? The only reason i like apple is because of there big screens and apple iPads and phones are fast."
"worst customer service I've ever experienced, constantly passed for one person to another, did not listen to what I had to say just wanted to keep telling me Apple policy - appalling service"
"Disgusted and appalled!!!  I have been an iPhone user for over a decade, I bought my iPhone 11 from an apple store, it started acting up very shortly (getting stuck, touch not working, charging was unbearable) I got in touch with the support and they asked me to send it off so I did just that, my phone was gone for a whole week, I’m working from home. Comes back and nothings wrong with it they say. A few weeks using the phone again. My phone gets so warm that it leaves a indentation on my futon, phone would repeatedly get warm, stuck, battery would die so fast and take so long to charge, for in touch with them again detailing everything and sending photos of the damage caused by the phone. They asked me to send it off again, comes back with nothing is wrong with it. So apparently I’m supposed to wait for it to blow in my face before they can do something about it. Yesterday I spent 2hrs on the phone and still nothing. Sorry nothing we can do, 8 months of this. Working from home, sent my phone away twice, 5 restarts later! They can’t do anything for me. I am so over iPhone. I paid a hefty amount for this phone for it to act up just a few weeks of using it."
"I have just telephoned Apple to discuss buying a new computer. I explained that the last time that I purchased a Mac, the system was configured by an Assistant in the store and that I would need this service again. I was immediately told that, ""this would be difficult with Covid 19"" to which I replied, ""I don't see why, you can maintain social distancing and provide the same service"" with no risk to your customer spending £ 1500+ or the Assistant providing the service.I have now decided to buy a Samsung who will provide the level of service that I expect."
"Very disappointed with apple in the last few years...When apple launched the first Iphone (which was an upgraded copy of PALM phone or TREO (if i remember correctly). The design and technology behind it was pretty good, they improved what was already in the market, fine !. Every phone, every year after that, had something new to offer. However, from a few years back, they only increase  ... processor, , retina ""XYX"", now is glass instead of aluminium, next year is aluminium ""XYX"" instead of glass, next year the new color is red, etc.But they stopped""WOWing"" customers with advanced designs, or specs, etc. I spoke for me here, a faster processor ?? Well, probably needed only because, as we know after a few system upgrades or months, ""somehow' the phone magically slows down, but, ok ok, we understand products ""cant be forever"" right. I still have a Mac desktop, ipad, iphones, ipods and iphones from all generations, but then I stopped buying new products 2 years ago. Face ID recognition ?, I think this feature was launched by HTC 7 years ago ?? probably others before that ?Seriously, I used to love apple and use their products, NOW, I feel used by the brand. Again, I don't complain about pricing ... but the price tag, should be next to a product that WOWs us next to it.Waiting for the APPLE messiah ..."
"Apple products sucks. They charge your account for absolutely everything. They’re policies contradicts itself. I don’t understand the big Hooray about Apple. They’re the sorriest company I know. I took my card off my Apple account, so when my grand daughter play games on my phone she can’t charge anything with my card and my password. So how my 8 year old granddaughter obviously tried to charge some games. When it was time to update my phone, Apple wouldn’t allow me to update unless I put a card on file. Once I put my card on file and updated my software, Apple charged my card for almost $100. LaShawn, one of Apples supervisor told me that Apple allows credit to be billed up. Apple is a rip off and a scam! I had to give a star in order to post my review other than that I would have given Apple a meg 10 star rating! I’ll never purchase anything from Apple again. I’ll rather go back to Android! And I am! Horrible customer service! Just horrible! The other day, a Caucasian friend of mines called Apple support and told them about Billings on her account and they immediately refunded her money. Apple is racist and yes they definitely discriminates."
"I purchased an HP printer via the Apple store app. The first time I changed the cartridge, the clip securing it broke off. After much difficulty working out how to contact Apple about this, they stated there is nothing they can do as it is not an Apple product. I am appalled at their customer service."
"They are literally trying to take 30% from charity causes through facebook community pages. Apple has always sucked. If you want a decent gaming experience just buy a pc or console, or an android and get your games from the companies themselves. There is no need to get all philosophical about fortnite, it's simple. Apple belongs in 1984."
"Utterly rubbish build quality of AirPod pros. £250 and I’ve had them replaced 3 times in less than one year! First the right ear started buzzing/crackling, then the wireless charging case stopped charging (it occasionally gets hotter than the sun - so no surprise there), now a month later the left AirPod has given up. It’s awful what’s happened to Apple over the years. They used to be known for reliability, now it’s just utter crap."
"It is just awesome can't say more."
"Terrible experience. My 2019macbookAir is 4 months old. The display started malfunctioning. I am a student that works full time, and with classes being online I have not moved my computer from my desk. The turn around is over 10 days. Apple had no solutions or helpful options. I am just supposed to be without a computer for 10 days despite it being brand new, purchased from Apples website, and I have Apple care plus. I would never have bought this laptop if i knew they were going to close down all of their stores without offering different options for support. Could not be more disappointed unless they didnt tell me that they could overnight the computer...oh wait, they didn't tell me that they could send a box and have it overnighted...i was left with the option to take it to a simply mac who wanted to charge a $50 rush fee. The simply mac store ended up having to send it to Apple to repair because they think the entire display needs replacement.  So basically it is a manufacturing error. Apple offered no solutions other than an apology and a 10 day wait."
"Bring back fortnite"
"Approximately two weeks if you receive my phone almost a year and a half ago Siri started doing really crazy thing my phone was acting crazy I reported it they said maybe she Was misunderstanding me the white everything else started over and got worse year and a half later they want me to pay for another phone then they will send me back the money that they filled accordingly even though it’s been happening since I got a brand new Apple do not stand behind it now I can’t turn on Wi-Fi sometimes my data gets turned off alarms get turned off I’ve had nude porn sent to my daughters I’ve had vulgar messages sent to my daughter or friend Siri I want the phone back but they want me to pay full price to get another one and then they will give me back accordingly since I have not been able to do that every day there’s something else not working on my phone and I don’t think that’s a coincidence that’s the way to force me to trade mine in the bed of the year and a half old and the battery will only hold a charge for an hour and unused dead in 45-1 hr.I reported every step of this to Apple with no response other than money not one single apology been hung up on several timesCall And called a liar"
"Terrible! I purchased a Macbook air that included Airbuds for free. When I received the confirmation email, the Airbuds were not included. On top of it, delivery is 2 weeks so I need to drive 30 minutes to the nearest store with a 15 minute pick up window. First I chatted, then I called, they would not help unless I cancelled the order (they would take 5 days to refund my money) and order again (another $1000 with no guarantee the Airbuds would be included in this order) Awful, will never order direct from Apple again."
"Apple update bricked my ipad and they wanted 250.00 to fix it just because I had the screen replaced by a third party vendor. Be forewarned consumers, think carefully before you think Apple is your friend."
"Excellent service when I had some serious problems with my 7 year old MacBook. I was assigned a senior advisor who was in touch with me over several days by email and phone. They were knowledgeable, patient, helpful, polite and reassuring, and fixed the problem. And at no charge. Can't fault this really."
"Y'all deleted my chats on WhatsApp I'm still suffering from the repercussions of misinformation I've been getting from Apple advisers. Who's the manager?!?!?! I wanna talk. After having another phone call to get my Instagram and WhatsApp accounts back, an adviser told me my WhatsApp data is not coming back due to misinformation I was told (aka I had to wait ""24 hours"" to get my accounts back). Because of this, my phone was backed up multiple times and it's basically impossible for me to get those contacts back. RIP I guess. Thanks Apple, you've driven me down a rabbit hole of trash and turmoil. Do everyone a favour, fire everyone that works for the company and get people who actually know what they're talking about."
"What the heck is wrong with Apple support?  My daughter's iphone 11 did the continuous boot loop thing for the third time in 2 months and Apple Support was abhorrent.  They kept wanting to call her when her phone was inoperable due to the continuous boot loop issue.  They kept asking for the serial number when there was no way to get to it through the phone.  There is no reason why the can't cross reference this with the phone number or name.  What the heck???  Hours spent trying to work with them.  Finally had to walk them through the logic to get the information they needed.  If this crap happens to me, I'm moving to Samsung."
"My MacBook Air was only 14 months old when it broke. We went to get it fixed and they said it would cost $600. Of course, we immediately considered our options and knew that to just buy a new one would cost $1000. So we said no to the fix and we called Apple to see if there was some way to work out a deal to trade it in for some credits. The service was robotic. We were looking to talk with a human being that would work out a deal with us. The service people were kind but they were just reading from the same rule sheet. We are very disappointed with Apple in this situation. This shows that Apple doesn’t care about keeping customers happy. A MacBook Air should not fail after 14 months."
"Purchased a 27” iMac 5K 2019 model, after a few months use in a normal clean house, a small insect managed to get stuck in the space between the glass and the lcd panel. Apple’s response? Warranty doesn’t cover ‘debris’ under the screen! Surely a £1800 machine should be built well enough that a common household insect cannot get inside the allegedly sealed screen unit?!?! They make great products but clearly couldn’t care less about their customers. Steve Jobs would be turning in his grave."
"They can go to hell because I paid for a year sub and now can’t use it because I can’t pay for my other subs so big waste of money fuckking tards it like if you payed for Xbox live for a year and then buy a month of game pass, oops game pass can’t renew so no live for you until you pay for your game pass. Most stupid s h i t I have ever seen"
"APPLE IPHONE XR SERVICE! My iphone has stopped working in the warranty period.  The seller Digi-E has gone out of business.  OnBuy do not answer emails and do not have a telephone number.It turns out my Apple iphone is an American model, so cannot be repaired by Apple in the UK.  Apple USA can’t repair it because the iphone is in the UK.  That’s ok until your iphone just dies overnight (a known problem with the Iphone XR), then you’re well and truly screwed.  Apple USA sold this phone to AT&T, who then sold it on to Digi-E, who I bought my Iphone from.  So, basically I have no phone and I’m £589 worse off 10 months later.11 days have gone by and I’m told to wait for Digi-E to contact me because ‘they must be busy with lockdown orders!’  Their emails bounce and their website is down, so I can’t even get hold of them.APPLE – THE BLAME IS AT YOUR DOOR, IT’S YOUR PRODUCT, YOU SOLD IT ON WITHOUT CHECKING WHERE IT WAS GOING - SO WHY CAN’T YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT – MORE TO THE POINT, WHY DO YOUR IPHONE’S NOT LAST VERY LONG!"
"thick end of 2 grand for a Mac book pro, 150£ cheaper on amazon, apples reply ? bring it back for a full refund and buy it from amazon, they are not an authorised reseller . I have been buying apple all my life, iPhone 1 Q's out of the shop ? I was that guy . Done now, will buy anything but ....seriously ? bring it back for full refund ? oh to that big a business where it doesn't matter lol"
"Amazing supporthad a problem with signing on to outlook from my MacBook whilst still getting in from other devices. One call to apple support, real person on the phone in less than 2 minutes. An excellent, patient, friendly adviser took me through the problem step by step, solved it, then showed me an even better way to deal with my mail going forward. Fast, competent, helpful, as one would expect from brilliant apple support. Really unique these days where everyone else fobs you off on webpages and chatbots or you hang on a phone line for hours to then talk to a useless adviser somewhere. Thats why I buy apple devices."
"I just bought the pro computer and I open the box and only the display was in it (5,000$!!!) and only to find out I need to pay another 1000$ to hold the b*tch and  I was like okay yk the phones I can pay for that but if you’re going to charge me another 1000$ to hold up your product! that I sold a KIDNEY for I’m going to expect it to be able to stand it’s self up but apparently they want me to f****ng lay the monitor on the ground yk what not even on the floor it’s going to be on the dirt cause I’ll be too broke to have a house by then it’ll be on the dirt on the side of the road"
"Wow...... Really apple, ive been using apple since 2012,now it looks like android is 500% better, apple iphones always go down and go super slow at like 10fps with even offline games. Even my macbook which just BROKE WHILE I WAS MAKING A VIDEO. like seriously what the heck is wrong with your products? ""10/10 products apple..""also extreme cashgrab and lying, the macbook said it was 2.4GHZ so it should be at 240hz, well guess what? Its only 60hz which is 0.6GHZ, you are a liar apple. And who spends 50 dollars on AN ADAPTER JUST TO CHARGE YOUR MACBOOK? thats bullcrap, you could buy an upgraded ryzen 5 + specs for 850 dollars... Or you could spend 1500 dollars on the macbook air and all the charging and things needed to use it."
"Overall, after using various Apple Inc products since 2008, I have to conclude the the products are basically garbage. I don't think the IT engineers at Apple have a clue what they are doing and because of that you'd have to conclude that the other departments are the same. I got into computers in the mid to late 1980's and at that time considered there offings third rate compared to what else was available. This is why it took me until the late 2000's to take a chance on them. I've spent money replacing their products than any other company in my entire life. They are garbage, just pure garbage. Fortunately there are many ways now to get the sources I use other than Apple and I'm in the process of re installing retro sound systems in my home with the new high quality systems available that weren't available before 1989."
"I spoke to someone today, I didn't catch their name. The gentleman was such a great help and I am so thankful. Resolved my issue in minutes and sorted everything for me. So polite, great team!"
"Karen again,Hey so my daughter was showing me how to use my iphone last night and she keeps telling me that i need to update. I do what she says: Setting-general-iphone update and it says that my iphone is up to date at ""ios 7.3.7"". My daughters is at something like ios 13 and as i only bought my top of the range iphone 3g in 2010, i would expect it to be in its prime and in exellent condition!! This isnt good enough as my phone is almost brand new. I thought Iphone was meant to be unbeatable quality?. Not happy Apple, you have let me down. Karen.#letawomandown #letmedownwhydontyou? #issamsungthewaytogo? #bringbackthenokia #3310 #karensupset #mommydaughterbondingtime"
"Absolutely terrible customer service and defective flagship product that Apple know about but still sell.Bought new Mac Pro in April 2020 - Apple’s flagship system - but due to exorbitant cost charged by Apple for upgrades to the base system I chose just above the base, with a view to using third party components - priced at half what Apple was charging (as per the tech advice in numerous expert videos on you tube).  Advised Apple in advance of the need to upgrade it - even got clarification on what components would work/were compatible and the specifications - even confirmed the third party suppliers and tech support had no concerns. Within a week the first system started crashing - did everything I could and everything Apple tech support advised - nothing worked.  Apple finally agreed the system was defective and none of the third party components was to blame - I had even removed all of these (RAM and additional ssd) and still system crashed in Apple factory sold configuration.  Apple agreed to replace the system completely - but nothing for the 8 weeks of wasted time, phone calls etc.The 2nd system was delivered in June and ran for 3 weeks before the same thing - crashes continually and randomly.  I hadn’t even copied any data or installed any third party RAM or ssd.  Upgraded and re-installed full operating system - several times, sent data dump to Apple at their request - to hear nothing, installed RAM and ssd at Apple request and removed it again at Apple request - Mac Pro still crashed repeatedly and would not copy any files.  I suggested it was a defective machine and something seemed inherently wrong for 2 to have the same issues.  I also suggested that Apple own operating system was significantly faulty (something echoed all over the web) - Apple refused to accept any of it.  Lastly I queried if their fabled T2 security chip might be the issue and one senior tech support made an aside comment of Apple having lots of problems since introducing it. Apple suggested taking the machine away for several weeks and then letting have it back if they could repair it.  I pointed out I had paid for a new working machine not a repaired one.  After ignoring a number of my emails Apple finally agreed to refund the whole system (incl the XDR monitor).  However I pointed out I had purchased third party components to upgrade the machine and would be significantly out of pocket with no machine to use them in and they were not defective.  Apple accepted they (third party components) were not defective but refused to even discuss the cost.  I pointed out that legally these were direct costs and Apple had sold the system as upgradeable (so should expect people to do this) and I had advised Apple of my intention to do this before buying the Mac Pro.  Apple took advice from it’s legal dept and queried how much I’d paid for the additional components. I thought they were finally being reasonable but no their response to me advising of the cost was to again ignore my emails and mere re-state they would only refund the original purchase from Apple.  I appealed to senior Apple exec’s including Tim Cook but none answered and Apple exec customer service continued to ignore anything but the option they wanted.  In essence bullying their customer - I either accept a repaired machine (although no one could actually explain what they intended to repair) - not what I paid for.  Or I got a refund and was stuffed for the 3rd part components - which couldn’t be returned as they worked perfectly well !!.  Over the years I’ve been a loyal Apple customer and spent a lot of money with them but all that counts for nothing.  I did try register a complaint about their exec customer relation - but guess who deals with those complaints - yep ! The very person who has been responding all along - so totally useless. All in all, 5 wasted months, 2 defective Apple flagship products, appalling customer services, totally dis-interested senior exec’s just looking to cash in their own shares.  Wish I’d looked more carefully at the level of bad reviews on here - even if some are incorrect - just the sheer level of bad would be a red flag to any other company - but Apple don’t really give a fig for their customers at all.  I’m sure some of their general staff are good and some of the tech support were fine (just couldn’t fix the issues), but exec customer relations needs a new name - perhaps “do what you want the customer can’t do anything service”.   A flagship system, sold at very inflated price should work - Apple’s certainly does not ! And don’t ever try to upgrade an Apple system (even if they say you can) cos when the system crashes - you’ll be left with all the costs and wasted time - Apple will just ignore you.I could not recommend avoiding Apple more strongly - if they treat someone spending thousands this way what hope has anyone got !"
"I have never had a strong desire to type something out, till now. I have been in customer service for over 19 years now and I have NEVER experienced the type of treatment I have experienced at (Store Location: 70 Oakbrook Center, Oakbrook, IL 60523).There were two associate’s, one by the name Deyna, who I had my appointment with and  the other associate name was Ryan. I walked into Apple store on a Monday and received the BEST treatment in any store EVER. Deyna was so very nice and informative. I had so many questions and concerns and she was able to assist with them all. I also came across Ryan while talking to Deyna and the work relationship they have is AWSOME. It’s the type relationship we all hope and expect to have while working in customer service (an awesome team) I was able to share some thought about my IMac with them and the direction I wanted to take, they were so positive, uplifting and showed so much empathy.  I left out of Apple Store being so much more knowledgeable of my device. I have NEVER walked out of a store smiling as hard as I did on this day (let alone on a Monday). Shortly into our conversation after me meeting Deyna, I asked her “Do you love your job”? she didn’t even hesitate, she quickly said “YES”.  I believe people who love their jobs give the BEST customer Service. Deyna told me she enjoyed her job and she love working for apple, from what I witness there is no doubts about that. Its been a long time since I have heard someone talk so highly of their job.  Thank you for all the help, awesome customr service and keeping me safe from Cov-19. Please!! Keep up the Amazing Job"
"don't buy apple products , after updating my iphone 6+ its unable to activate i contacted apple support they never help me and they told me go away and we won't help you"
"Please note that I bought a new I Phone 8 from the Birmingham apple store on 17 September 2019. After a couple of months, I went to the Apple store in Birmingham and talked to the Technician that I do not get a green acceptance button when somebody calls me on Whatsapp. He said we don't deal with Whatsapp, you should contact them directly. How can I contact them? It is absurd.I still have this problem. Now the major problem is : When I swipe down the screen from certain point, It turned blank. To revive the screen I have to turn off then turn on. Upon turn on, a very dim Passcode appears which are very hard to see. Even Apple Technician in the Apple store noticed this flaw upon my latest visit to the Birmingham store on 26 August. She put me off. for your kind information, I am a disabled person with multiple disabilities. I have to call the Ambulance quite often. This Phone is my lifeline. If this happens in emergency I could be in sheer trouble. I asked for a refund so I can buy another brand. On 26 August I have to wait more than 4 Hours, What a shame. I am Harjinder Singh Dhillon."
"Incredibly rude customer service reps, no words for how unprofessional this whole experience was."
"I received a brand new iPhone (Australia) and on plugging in the charger to fully charge the phone, it did not work. Used another charger for a different iPhone and the new iPhone charged perfectly. The new charger was faulty. Called Apple to ask a replacement charger and cable. Apple support said they would replace the cable, free of charge. Awesome. However, they want to charge postage of $18 for the cable. The amount is not the issue, it's the principle. You fu*king p*icks are more than happy to take the publics money, but when it comes to true after sales service, you are sorely lacking. So take your fu*king service and shove it up your fu*king a*se. If you want a better review, offer premium service. The end."
"Shthole company putting profit over customer. Not innovative anymore. Recent iPhone 11 Pro Max (stupid name anyway) is not even properly working and has many bugs! Apple wouldn’t help me with the problem that the background screensaver didn’t move when touching the screen. In store they said: we can’t help you we don’t know. They always tell you it’s a iOS version problem and to wait or go set up the device from 0. Fckng losers!"
"Just had a dreadful experience with apple. £1500 iphone, just out of warranty, borked by a software update I didn't want -- they wanted £550 to fix it. Belligerent staff in the Reading apple store. Having spent thousands of pounds on apple products over the years, I will definitely be reconsidering giving them any more cusotm."
"Apple are useless,misinformed by customer services now locked out of account for 21days this company is useless its products aren't much better going back to android steer clear of Apple just an over priced second rate company and product....."
"Amazing products but the systems they require their customer service reps to use are ridiculous.Took nearly an hour on the phone to get a refund for a faulty product??? The Greek girl I spoke to was really nice and did her best but she was so restricted by Apple systems. Never again will I buy direct from Apple."
"I don’t even know where to start. I guess I will start off with the fact that apple is extremely greedy and money hungry. This isn’t something new, it has been going on for years. First it was the special charger cables, then if you tried to get your apple device fixed they wouldn’t fix it. They would tell you it had water damage or something. Then they tried to run out third party businesses by telling customers that you can’t get replacement phones. Let’s not forget the error message they programed into phone so they just shut off. It caused millions of people to have to buy news phones ( that were actually refurbished using the phones they returned). Then there is a new charging cable, then there isn’t an aux jack so you are forced to buy special equipment to use a regular aux cord or be forced to use theirs. Now it is the 30% fee they are taking from people when they invest their money into something they want to buy. When will it stop? When will people realize that this company is a sham. They sell outdated technologies for triple the price it should cost and call it new Innovated technology. It is complete bs. I currently own a 6s but I can tell you that I’m never getting another apple product again. They aren’t for small businesses, they are just money hogs, and thieves."
"i came to apple today and an employ outside the store started to try convince me to buy new airpods when i was just trying to fix them beacuse the sound wasn't good. Then when it was time for my scheduled meeting i asked if they could fix it for me and they said sure and it was for free turns out it was a manager named Brett. Thanks for the help man"
"F (IGNORE THIS) U (IGNORE THIS) CK (IGNORE THIS) U"
"This is my third iPhone.  I also have a Mac Air.  I always get the AppleCare support package.  I sure appreciate the help l am given when l have a problem.  Today a young man named Andres was so incredibly kind and patient and helpful to me.  I hope his superiors see this.  Good employees are indispensable.  Thank you for helping me through the confusion. They are lucky to have you.  I can sense what a wonderful person you are without meeting you."
"Have found Apple software non-universally friendly and specified software needed to run this and that  unlike android, Windows, Google and other examples which connect in a more simplistic way.  Above their overpriced merchandise I have to say that they are taking advantage of their loyal customers by deliberately slowing down older models (admitted in court) and force thier customers to pay more for apps, for example, you tube premium costs an extra £5 per month just simply for having an Apple device due to their 30%  greed policy which no other competitors do and althoughI don't play fornight, I respect them for taking a stand. I hope they will change their attitude and approach to these things and start showing more responsibility and respect to thier customers."
"I have owned my Iphone X for around two years. The screen first turned green and will only show the restore screen now. I have tried to restore/update and restore the phone to factory settings but it will not accept the software from itunes. Phone has not been dropped and is taken care of. Because the phone is not insured I will not be paying to repair or replace it. Apple seems to make great paper weights. I should have never switched from Android based phones. Samsung will get my business. Thanks for screwing your customers over for profit."
"I bought a iphone SE and it was cracked i would like a refund"
"I will No longer be using the App Store to buy my games because since they have blocked fortnite from the AppStore they are the stupidest company ever and they should not block fortnite you suck"
"Since Epic Games decided to defy the App Store policy (although anti-competetive, but not in this sense), Fortnite was removed. Now there are an influx of kids saying Apple is bad because of this.On the other hand, some of their products cost too much for the crappy specs, e.g: i5 MBP."
"Apple is,not a company if you have lost a loved one that used Apple products. It is best if you bury the products if you do not have the passcode (not AppleID) of the deceased and original receipts.  I received a 'WHATEVERr' from their customer service representative (Angela?).  I just needed to have the devices wiped and no longer interested in obtaining the data.  Apple Is No Help! Apple will bury you in their process. If I am unable to locate original receipts the family is stuck with products they can't use...but Apple Got Their Money!  Just call me frustrated widow."
"Always helpful to be honest. Really happy with their custom service :)"
"I was hung up on by customer service because I said having to drive 45 minutes one way to an Apple store was a nuisance (I did not curse or insult anyone). I tried to file a complaint and was given ""the run around"" and ultimately was hung-up on again by the lady who was supposed to be taking my complaint about being hung up on...I will never use an Apple product again."
"For blocking fortnite bring it back or I will never ever buy any apple products ever again!!! :("
"The worst and the greediest company EVER! They should be ashamed of themselves. I am selling all my Apple devices. Go to hell, rotten Apple!"
"**** Apple for taking off FORTNITE!**** Apple!"
"Apple removed fortnite they are being petty over the whole situation and they over price there phones when they are crap and break super fast everyone that I know that has an iphone will be switching to Samsung including me shame on you apple your always after people's money"
"BRING FORTNITE BACK OR ELSE jk BUT PLE ADD IT BACK IM STUCK WITH PLAYING ON XBOX"
"I’ve been with Apple for a while now and it was all good until they decided because of one incident they were going to cut the whole fortnite game from App Store, a very popular game for no reason. I am beyond disappointed"
"They are a lying disgraceful company! They told me when I bought 11 pro max, watch, AirPods and screen protector I would be covered on all my products. I have apple care and lost my AirPod and they won’t replace cause now they tell me they don’t cover that. My screen protector is cracked and they told me to contact that company. I bought everything at the Apple store and they miss informed me about everything. Never trust Apple!!!"
"I am BEYOND effin frustrated after trying to order a new iPad online. I’ve had an agent tell me my “order bag” of a refurbished iPad would be saved for 14 days. It wasn’t. I’ve tried countless times to get my new order processed online, with the same error message coming up. I’ve been on the phone w customer service so long I’m cooked!I’ve talked on the phone w the Apple Card issuer, Apple tech support, sales support, agents, supervisors, text message agents, you name it. I’ve tried to complete the sale on my old iPad and my newer iPhone. The end today was after 2+ hours on the phone, on hold a 1/3 of that time, the call WAS DROPPED! And of course Apple hasn’t called me back, and I don’t know the name of the supervisor to call them back. I dont want to go to the Santa Barbara Apple store, even if they are open. All I want to do is copy and paste this review all over town. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"very poopy I cannot download fricking update to iOS 12 on iPhone 5s because iTunes it's fricking reatarded"
"I brought 2 pairs of Apple AirPod pros. For 6 months they worked great but after that both pairs started having a whistling sound. Since they were still under warranty, I called Apple, and they said that they would send me replacement pairs. They would also put a $400 hold on my card until I return the old pairs with the whistling sound. I received the AirPods within 2 days; however, I received 2 left ears. I called Apple and asked if I could pair the left ear with my old right ear and they said I could. They also stated that the right ear would arrive in 7 business days. I tried and tried to pair the left ears, but to no avail, so I called Apple tech support. The tech support rep was real nice but even she could not get the AirPods to pair together. They had 2 different firmwares and we couldn't get the new AirPod firmware to update. We had no choice but to wait until the right AirPods arrive and attempt to pair them. In the meantime she had to ask for extension of when we could return the old AirPods; however, my $400 is still on hold. Apple should not be sending replacement parts that do not work or only 1 AirPod at a time. They should also have it do that people can drop off the item at an Apple store and come back and pick it up. I spent over 3 hours on the phone trying to get something to work that never did and I believe that Apple should be aware of this problem and make corrections. Apple has recently removed their review section on their website so customers are not allowed to post reviews."
"I recently gave my phone to Best Buy to be repaired through Apple Care. They told me it would take 1-2 weeks max. Two weeks in I called Best Buy and they said Apple still has my phone working on it. I thought I’d be patient and wait a little longer, three weeks and a day after, Best Buy had called me to ask how my phone is, which I haven’t gotten it back. They checked with Apple and Apple won’t send the phone back. So Best Buy had to give me their phone from another location. I appreciate Best Buy’s help to solving the solution. I expected BETTER service from Apple ! Plus I think they need to communicate better with other service providers and to their consumers about the status and progress of a consumers product !"
"Just bought an Apple watch series 5. So excited initially that I want to set it up right away in a coffee shop. But the watch has no charge at all. It won't start. Immediately walk to the Apple shop and ask them to test it if any issue with the watch. They said you better try at home and come again tomorrow if it does not work. And it all happened in less than 15 mins in Westfield Apple shop. As if I do not have a life except chasing Apple customer service. I am paying you 500 pounds and you wont give me a product that work?????? You guys seriously need to think about this."
"Tried to get apple to repair my Powerbeat Pro headphones which I was gifted 6 months ago. Clearly apple have great looking products we all want. God forbid anything goes wrong with them. My earbuds were assessed as having been water damaged. I told them this was sweat and that they are sold as sweat and water resistant. They shrugged their shoulders and asked for 79.17 to repair them. I refused so they told me there was nothing they could do for me."
"My mother and I always bought Apple products. They were always excellent, since when we both bought two iPhone 8. They both broke in less than a year. The screen total black, the phone dead. “That’s okay, maybe it was a factory defect” we thought, and bought again the same exact iPhone. Another time they had the same problem. We brought them to apple, and even them couldn’t do anything to fix the problem. They also said “Perhaps it’s a defect. Buy a new one!”. My mother and I work at the same company, and we both must have a functioning phone to receive calls and to telephone clients. I was planning to buy a MacBook Pro, but I’m reconsidering... I don’t intend to spend three thousand dollars on a product that “maybe” is going to break inexplicably. So an advice for people who have a normal job. DO NOT BUY products that last less than a year and then break after the guarantee is expired."
"Apple is a most RIP OFF company in this earth. my 15 year old daughter is obssesed with Apple products and I have bought her Apple mac Air in May'20. She takes very good care for all her belongings and her previous HP laptop was 5 years old and never had a scratch and I am using now. On Saturday evening she opened her laptop and found the craks on the bottom of the screen so she called had spoken to Apple's customer care and they said that she has to PAY £550 because it was a PHYSICAL DAMAGED!! How can you physically damage the bottom of screen? I will URGE people to think about 1000x before get an Apple products.I will NEVER buy any of your products because in my opinion, you are one of the BIGGEST CONN in the business history!!"
"i love apple, there apps and updates but i dont have the latest stuff because they are too pricy, since this update ios 13 started i cannot update my ipad 4 since its ""too old"" If apple sees this Apple company pls bring ios 13 update to older apple stuff because people cannot pay to buy a new ipad"
"This company is pathetic and we are to blame because we buy their product. I called for support because my phone would not end a call and kept vibrating. The technician made me update my iPhoneX to IOS13 since then everything got screwed up. I also asked for a quote $279 to replace my cracked screen. She arranged for an appoint. During the pandemic I made my way to the Apple Store to fix my screen and waited forever to be seen my an arrogant technicien who enjoyed telling me that my screen was going to cost me $365 plus tax. I explained that I was quoted over the phone $279. He explained that my quote was in US$. The idiot had all my coordinate and knew very well that I was Canadian. Man this is highway robbery and without remorse. I waisted my day and exposed myself during the pandemic and heard no apology. I almost wanted to give him the middle finger when he suggested that I should upgrade my phone. By the way I am a senior citizen. Shame on you Apple"
"I bought for my son 2 years ago a MacBookfor$1800.After 2 years is it shout down, there is more than 6 months since was returned and not fixed yet.I have an ASUS laptop paid $500 for 5 years, no problems at all.Stay away, from APPLE"
"Apple is an absolute soul sucking crime against humanity. Their products are ridiculously over priced, the company is greedy, the customer service is terrible, the product is over rated and I think we should all reject apple technology at all costs."
"For anyone that values their family photos and precious moments, don’t get an Apple phone!! Within a week before the new software update I had no chance of saving my pics I deleted so much stuff only for system and other to take it all back up! I was shut off everything then woke up to my phone stuck in recovery mode!! I have completely learnt my lesson! Lost so so many precious family memories! No warning nothing had no chance to solve it!  So expensive for what they are!!"
"Had such a battery drainage issue and spoke to two excellent people and they were able to resolve my issue right away! Thanks again Apple"
"Their customer service sucks now. They know they have the market and just don’t give a crap about customer satisfaction."
"Apple use to be synonymous with quality, you knew the price tag was high, but you were getting a great quality product that would last, those days are well and truly over! I purchase a pair of Airpods 2 and just as they went out of warranty (how convenient) they are a goner. during their life they continually had connection issues, one bud would not charge at the same rate as the other, and would drain super quick compared to the other, they would not connect for longer than 5 minutes to my Macbook Air (Could be Catalina that version of OSX is a disaster) lesson learnt no more Apple products for me, cheaply made, poorly engineered tat with poor software, sold for an extortionate price tag, avoid if you like stuff that works as intended."
"I have been a long time Apple customer. I have had many products from Apple with no issues. When I have had to call customer support, normally they are helpful and do everything they can to help me. Even with the issue being operator error. I purchased a MacBook Pro in 2015, and Apple has issued a recall on that model I have, but my serial number is not listed as being affected by the recall. They didn't want to even look at it. Said I had to pay $220 to get it fixed. Stats on the battery, 193 cycle count, less than 2% of the life expectancy. The computer has run hot since purchased, never hurt me, but has come close to burning me. It appears to me Apple is moving away from supporting their customers to nickel and diming them. Maybe if Steve Jobs was still around. Save your money, buy cheaper computers from someone else. You'll come out ahead if you ever have to repair an Apple engineering issue. It's to bad that Apple has moved away from treating their customers with respect."
"Hard to use, loads of images and needless stuff, couldn't find where to order easily. Finaly ordered a macbook pro and airpods, then they told me it would be 2-3 weeks shipping. Wasnt clear before I bought it and they said that it would be next day on the website. Offered no help to speed it up. I find more and more these days that apple leverage the power of their brand to take advantage of their customers."
"less that 2 years ago i stupidly bought their airpods for a wopping $160. i am not rich or wealthy at all and this was a big purchase for me. i was expecting them to last me a few years but after less than 2 they have stopped working. this is an absolute joke! i used to like this company but now i just think they are bad. update: i asked their support and they said all they can do is sell me their new ones for $250. they wont even let me trade them in for a discount."
"8/20/2020I have a MacBook notebook from Apple. Since the stores are closed right now, I can only depend on phone customer service. The wait is too long and even scheduling online appointments, Apple does not return the calls. It is a real nightmare. Two nights ago, I had the worst senior adviser I ever met remotely at Apple. His name was Douglas and he was very rude, impatient and not friendly at all. I noticed from the beginning of the call and should have asked to speak to some one else but I knew that with nowadays situation, that won't be possible and I would have to disconnect that phone call and wait additional hours on the phone to get someone else. We started to re backed the computer and he promised to come back. He instructed me how to do it but never responded to my emails as instructed. It was a real nightmare to deal that grotesque person on the phone. Now if I should call back Apple, I would make sure I won't speak to Douglas any more."
"My new MacBook Air has a camera that is very blurry, much more than my Air that's five years old. They are not letting me call the local store to see if they have my same model. I had to call the main office and they said that they should. After they looked, they found out that they don't have that model. They said I need to wait a week to get a new basic version of MacBook Air. They also told me to buy it again online.... Seems like waste and the computer isn't that great."
"So I have an iPad that has frozen,I called costumer service and they made me a appointment to go ,get my iPad fixed ,guess what nothing got done sat in a parking lot for an hour on the phone with apple care with the end result that I have to pay $299.00 just for then to try to in freeze my iPad,I will never recommend getting a apple product ever and follow my sister and leave apple"
"Purchased an iPhone XS. £1000 for a phone and in 18 months the screen stops working on the left hand side. Phone has been in a case it’s whole life and screen protector. Went to Apple shop in centre MK a and they want £275 to fix it. What a joke. You can get better reliability from a £14.99 supermarket phone. So disappointed with the Apple brand. £1000 for a phone ! It doesn’t meet my expectations."
"Apple products are junk.  3 phones. Back camera stopped working. Called Apple for help several times.  They don't call back at the appointed time that they give you. Will not replace phones that are under 6 months old.  Please don't waste your money!!!"
"Just buy an android, its better"
"stop failing my ft calls bro I was on a almost 20 hour ft and yo dumbass failed it 😠"
"My iphone 7 is under its first year warranty and it hasn't worked well from the first day. Last iphone I waste money on. It doesn't ring when a call comes in, it wont update from itunes and makes noises for texts etc when it feels like it and apple are not willing to replace it. They are onto a good scam here! Not with me....no iphones next time. Samsung here I come."
"I was excited to purchase I phone 11From day one , i have had issues with the speaker, the screen freezes And people cannot hear me. Battery life is short I have apple care(waste) they still haven’t replaced the phone I can’t wait to get rid of it!"
"Apart from their tax evasion practices, they also have terrible customer service. Avoid if you can!"
"Bought a computer at the online Apple store.Was a lemon from the start but kept working with Apple Techs to supposedly solve the problems. One year on even worse. Now we have to negotiate a buy back.  No resolution and for us a waste of time and money. What has happened to this company? Very frustrating trying to navigate this company now. We are sure Steve Jobs would not be happy to see what is happening to the quality and customer service of Apple. Looks like it will end up like the former great company of ""Kodak."""
"What wonderful products but what a disgusting money-grubbing company! Always forever 'Updating' stuff that doesn't need updating.Ever tried calling these creatures? You have a conversation with their computer first and then the computer allocates you to various parts of the world where people work cheap. Many of their so-called 'experts' are hopeless. They recently 'broke' my Mac by their stupidity but then I guess you know what you get when Tim Cook pays peanuts."
"Bought a refurbished Mac Book Pro 16 and the first had an same issue of a faulty caplock.Swapped for another which had the very same problem of caplock not woking or requiring pressure to enable it. Apple organised for the collection and sent confirmation of receipt, and I subsequently received an email saying my money had been refunded. This was on 2 July.I believed Apple, and checked PayPal which showed an amount of £2,939. I stupidly didn't check to see if it was a credit until recently when I had a problem making a purchase elsewhere. I went through my bank stats and there was no refund from Apple.I rechecked PayPal which showed that of the £3,338 I paid to Apple, I was only refunded the £399 I paid for the after cover. My payment of £2,939 was not refunded. The figure of £2,939 I had seen over a month before was showing that I had only received a partial refund of £399 and £2,939 was what was outstanding.I went back and forth between my PayPal and bank account, finally contacting Apple by email adding screenshots. They never responded.I contacted Apple by phone and after repeatedly explaining and being passed around for over 45 minutes, I was promised a call back which never happened. I contacted Apple today to chase and the man from yesterday who had promised the call back (but never did), never left a note on the system, so there was no history of my contact. My calls are thankfully recorded.Anyway, I had to go through the lengthy process of being passed around, repeatedly asked the same questions and kept on hold, only to eventually be told that they'd made the full refund and that PayPal was responsible for my not receiving the refund. The proof? The same 'credit for return' note I had received on 3 July, which isn't proof of refund, but a commitment to refund.I contacted PayPal who not only confirmed that Apple had not refunded the £2,939 but also that if Apple had refunded the amount, it would have credited just as the £399 had done. They've now raised a dispute.Apple cannot refund the time invested in my running around for this, and the anxiety it has caused me. They also need to be taught to think outside the box. If a refund hasn't been received it's not enough to send the same email showing that a refund 'would be' processed, but confirming with your account team that it 'has debited Apple's account and was processed'Apple also needs to check its team for fraudulent activity, as this would have gone unnoticed and undetected had I not been impacted when trying to make a purchase. Iam now in a financial pickle while awaiting my money!!!Got to find that this has happened to others as well! Lesson is never to trust Apple's refurbished items, never trust Apple's refund commitments, and always triple check EVERYTHING!!! YouTube video showing the faulty mac books and screenshots of my emails, and call recordings to follow!"
"Contacted the Apple Accessabilty and Interactive Services Department at 11:20 pm EST on August 16, 2020.  The department is reserved to provide special assistance to customers who have visual, hearing, motor and learning impairments.The Senior Advisor screamed at me, assuming because of my impairments, and said ""Oh my God! You fu***** nutcase!""Apparently, the department is not set up to work with disabled people...or people in general."
"My teenage daughter saved n bought her own Airpods which messed up within a year..called..returned damaged airpods..had to leave $150 deposit until they proceeded our ""return"" (they said appx. 2wks). Sept. 2nd 2020 will be 4mths!!!! And I haven't got MY money back..this is ridiculous! And the confusion is on their side..last I spoke w/apple I was assured it was cleared n I'd get my $$ back..hasn't happened..so tired of calling & emailing. Very unprofessional! I'd rather buy $20 earphones over n over instead of ever purchasing from Apple"
"Apple has been making crappy products lately and their repair service sucks!! My brand new I phone 11 went down for no reason for the second time. They told us to send it in for repair. It took 2 and a half weeks for them to fix it!! Completely ridiculous! Then they promised to send it out next day because the repair took so long. They did not send it next day as promised. My daughters Air Pods have quit twice and we had to return them. I will never buy another apple product!!"
"This review is meant to show people why they shouldn't buy apple products and why apple is a terrible company in terms of customer service and their devices.On September 23, 2016, my iPhone 7 plus was purchased with apple care for $1500 from the apple store. No service claims were made during the 2 year apple care period as the phone was taken very good care of. The microphone on the phone has started to show intermittent problems since two weeks. The issue went away for a day or so after I hard reset the phone. This exact same issue and behavior turned out to be a common issue with this phone that has been experienced by many customers including the 223 who logged their complaints on the Apple discussions forum on the web link Clearly, this is a design problem that Apple knows about but denies it to avoid paying for all the unhappy customers.I have booked an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar at the Bayshore mall in the city of Ottawa. The front line worker and his manager (Eric Vinkle) both confirmed that this issue cannot be repaired and the entire phone has to be replaced for $449. I explained to them that this is a common issue with this model and that Apple has to fix it at their expense since my phone is in pristine condition and no visible or water damage could be detected. They looked up the phone and confirmed that it has not be brought in for service since it was purchased.The fact that they would not replace the defected components of the phone confirms that this is a bigger problem that Apple knows about but does not want to admit and bite the bullet. Apple put something in the new ios that causes issues in older iPhone's to force customers to ditch their expensive phones and buy new ones.I made a complaint on the Better Business Bureau against Apple, they refused to repair it as the apple care is expired. After responding to Apple, they wrongfully closed the case.If you want to save your money and don't want a headache, please don't buy an iPhone"
"- just to begin with-1. Wait time to speak with an advisor2. Communication skills 3. No available appointmentsHaving purchased 8 iPhones,3 iPads, a mac book pro, iMac, 27 inch iMac, and an apple tv, it's safe to say that I have been a long-standing customer of Apple. Unfortunately, many recurring ”incidents” make me rethink apple more than ever before. To mention a few- - Every time devices are updated, there are issues I have to deal with before they are fixed. - Display problems: 1. the iPhone detaching from the body, again? 2. Discoloration on the mac book ’PRO’? 3. A chipped glass on the side of 27 inch iMac- from what?- Multiple major software issues:on all devices - how many more times do I have to call support center and travel to the store to have it repaired? I only remember one time I had to take my old Toshiba for a service, yet by now, I recognize people in both stores (about a 35-minute drive from my home). Add a wait to be seen, and you have to take a day off at work to have your device working the way, it should be in the first place. And now, the iPad charging port is destroyed by using the original Apple supplied cable that came apart with regular use and left a broken piece inside?!I can go on, but it would be a waste of time. No one is going to take care of this out of warranty cost (for light use of a product that was once again advertised for ’PROFESSIONALS’),but me. But who cares about a consumer? it's just one another survey that will show nothing else but company's interest in sell and making money off of Apple care+ and then out of warranty repairs. The most I will get will be, ”I'm sorry”.Apple used to be proudly ’standing behind’ its products now it’s time ’to hide behind’, instead."
"I can't believe how terrible Apple product design and service have become. I used to love Apple for their care, security and eco-system.I had a MacAir 12"" and the keyboard had to be replaced every 6 months because they were defective. When the extended defect warranty ran out Apple sold me a 13"" saying it was an inch bigger and a pound heavier BECAUSE they fixed the keyboard defect. Untrue. They lied to my face.Turns out the 13"" is also on the keyboard defect list. also. Mine has already failed and it went in for repairs last week. The day after it was returned I started getting huge unauthorized charges on the credit card stored in the machine. I called Apple right away b/c most likely the thief worked for them.I spent 3 hours on hold being passed around two days ago. Lots of classical music, but no one to answer the phone. Keep in mind this is a call about FRAUD. Most companies staff the FRAUD lines.Yesterday on hold for 2:02:36 and they finally, supposedly take a report, and will get back to me w/ the case #.I just found out over $5000K in charges were made by while Apple had my computer for repairs. The thief bought an I-Mac Pro 27"" computer--I could never afford one of those for myself...and thousands of dollars in Sonos speakers, and a new I-phone...Today I had to call Apple back b/c they never sent any kind of report or claim #.7 more hours on hold or being transferred. One guy tells me if I want to know if a case was started and my case # I ""Have to file a Subpoena""--his name was Cleveland. Then I ask for his supervisor and Francisco in level 2 said he can't tell me if they took a report or the case #. Keep in mind I have been holding for help for 7 hours now. He says He's so sorry, but I can go to: a link that I am not allowed to post here, and make an online request. In about 5 BUSINESS days they will respond --on line--no calls allowed--to my request."" Gee thanks Francisco. At this point Apple won't even verify they took a claim and are looking into it. Lesson learned...the old Apple is dead! Second lesson...if someone steals thousands of dollars from you, call the cops. They'll do the investigation for you and they'll prosecute.Last sad lesson...Don't buy from Apple anymore. They have zero customer service in case you get your identity stolen and have it used while in their shop to run up thousands of dollars of purchases for Mac Pro's and Sonos speakers. They won't even take a report."
"Locked out by Apple and now device is useless"
"Horrible greedy selfish cheap slow, horrible products."
"I purchased a Mac Book Pro only for the screen to have horizontal lines across it a couple of days after the warranty expired. After doing some research I have since found out that this is a common fault with the model that I purchased. I have contacted Apple who have informed me that I will have to pay for the screen to be repaired. The laptop was £2600 and I have only had 25 months of use out of it. I wont be purchasing their products again."
"Apples is rubbish it’s an outrage a stupid ripoff"
"My Iphone suddently stopped working, and now I can't have it repair or my problem diagnosed.This is ultrageous for a client that have bought products from this brand for years"
"This is a bad joke what the apple is pulling after I dispute the $1579. charged on my credit card, they charge me again for $ 9.99. I talked to the manager of my bank and they said it will be instantly dispute it. I closed all my credit and debit cards and still getting access to my account. Without consumer's knowledge they do this. Apple, something needs to change........"
"apple makes great iphones with minimal bloatware that you can also delete if you want, and it has great optimization and iphones are very fast because of the industry leading a13 bionic chip"
"I have had apple phones since apples Iphone 4.They are the crappiest phone ever and i don't know why i keep getting a new one. You would think for how much you pay for them that they would last long without crashing. I've taken great care of my phones and they still end up crashing. I am very disappointed and will no longer going to be a customer of yours. A lot of people have had the same experiences as me and they agree. I was about to buy a mac book and iwatch but screw that now.  My phones stopped working as soon as i pay them off and don't bullcrap me saying some crap like about life span of the phone. Make better phones if your going to charge out the ass for them. POS This is the 5th phone i will have to replace due to software crashes and i had a lot of saved information on there that i will never get back. I would leave 0 stars if i could because your camera sucks too. Over all a basic generic crap phone. I am so mad that i just finished paying off this phone EARLY and then it crashes and your support team, dont get me started. You're RX is a crap phone, and your product just keeps losing quality. Very poor quality and cheaply built. If i knew better id think these were made in the USA because of how crappy they were made. Software was built by a bunch of monkeys. No other product crashes more then a Apple product. That should be your slogan"
"Manager is Very. And rude very bad Services in Dix 30Very very bad Services. Rate 0%"
"I understand we are in a crisis. Meanwhile, we are paying over $1,000 for phones from Apple or any other product and right now if something is wrong with either you can’t even get an appointment. Not one Apple repair support in a 60 mile radius of my home have availability and they are not showing any appointments after Tuesday next week. Next is send your cell phone to them for repair and wait weeks for return and until then you continue to pay high cell phone cost and no phone. Now, having no phone does not work for me and my family or my business. I have at least 13 Apple products and can’t get a appointment for a phone I had for 8-9 months. This is ridiculous. I tried to find an appointment from Maryland, Delaware, Pa and New Jersey and can’t make a Apple repair appointment In any locations or the listed states. I need to get out of using Apple as my provider for phones, computers, watches, IPAd, Apple TV because it really seem to not have been working for me. Very sad customer"

"I still do not understand why ppl like these proucts.  They are so cumbersome to use! and CS is a joke. I told the rep over and over, the more I delete off my phone the more storage the ""other/systems"" takes up and I cannot sync with Onedrive which gives me 1TB of storage.  She had me reset effectively killing any contacts I added since 2018!!!! then to reset my phone I wanted to send an authentication code!

"I’m absolutely fed up! I had issues with the 2016 Macbook pro where the retina display is melting off! I spoke to a Cohnan a T1 IT support technician where I sent him photographs and he had informed me it was a manufacturing error and I could have it fixed free of charge by any apple repair service. When I turned up to my appointment, the technician had told me I couldn’t get it fixed free of charge and needed a CS code. I returned home and got on the phone immediately where I spoke to a Dimitris Gazepis (a T2 apple support) where I voiced what had occurred. He asked for further information, such as my purchase receipt, and I spent an hour on the phone where he went back and forth talking to me and to the Bentalls Centre Kingston where he finally said that the store is willing to fix my computer as it was purchased from them and was a registered apple fault. I asked him over 3 times if there was a CS code on the case file where he replied yes. He wrote it down on the case notes that I need to book an appointment and I can have it fixed free of charge.Yet when I am finally able to book an appointment, the apple store said there wasn’t a CS code on my case and that they wouldn’t fix it because the extended warranty of the fault was 4 years and in their eyes I either don’t have the problem or its been so long that I’ve learnt to deal with it. I am 3 months out of their ‘warranty’! Bare in mind the countries been on lockdown for those 3 months! They then said I would have to pay £469 if I wanted a new screen.I am absolutely appalled with the way this case has been handled! From such a respected company you would think if they recognise an issue is their fault they would fix it! They have wasted my time and my money getting back and forth from place to place! I have been wrongly informed twice and have the written down case notes to prove it and I will be furthering this case with the county court."
"Honnestly, it looks like Apple stopped caring about their customers.I bought a totally upgraded 4000€ MacBook Pro 1.5 years ago, and can’t use it with a monitor!Every time I use it with a monitor the cpu goes up to 70% and it makes it impossible to use....Iv talked to countless Apple support agents over a chat, because they haven’t taken any appointment at Apple stores in over 6 months!Every time it’s the same story:-I would contact google chrome, because we think that this is why your cpu is up so high.This is so ridiculous! If tired using safari and it’s the exact same issue!!!I went to an authorized repair shop, and they told me that the issue is with the hardware and that it’s a common issue with Apple, most of their MacBook Pro ports are unreliable and cause these cpu issues!!!!"
"I have recently acquired an iPhone XS Max which is an apparently great phone but my experience with this has been quite terrible. Constantly freezes and I mean constantly the whole thing just feels faulty to me and this phone when new sold for around 1000 pounds. Here’s a thought apple instead just selling faulty items how’s about you actually make sure the phone works perfectly before selling it? I look forward to the day that apple is no longer fashionable and your company dies a slow death"
"I have had an I mac for about 2 years. I had an unexpected windfall and my laptop packed up and I was fed up with the system I had been using so I thought I would see what this Apple system was like and spent about £1300. My advice to anyone who values their sanity, and money, is simply overcome the urge to go ""upmarket"". The whole thing is a sloppy farce! I am faced with two choices: 1) find someone who wants to try Apple and sell the thing for whatever I can get for it. or 2) take my sledgehammer and smash the thing to pieces. That is how frustrating it is. Don't buy on impulse, as I did. Investigate!"
"I was sitting on a bench I had a screen protector on my iPhone 7 it dropped and my actual screen cracked I think apple should make there screens better because I just got the phone yesterday"
"I recently ordered an IPhone SE and a case for following day delivery. The parcel did not turn up from DPD as promised. I phoned both the couriers and Apple the following day as the tracking read that it had not yet arrived at the distribution centre. I was told that Apple had to trigger an investigation which I asked for.I was told the investigation would take 24 to 48 hours. 7 days later I still await the result. I have rung Apple four times to be told the investigation is ongoing. I eventually got through to a supervisor after a half hour wait, who told me I couldn’t have a replacement or a refund until the checks were finalised. The supervisor was Darren (at home). He wasn’t sympathetic or helpful at all. This company is so arrogant beyond belief. I have now asked my credit card company to start a chargeback procedure as it seems the only way I can get my money back.Apple were happy to charge me for the Phone on the day of despatch.As yet nothing from Apple except “wait”."
"Low quality product. Siri does not work for Iphone 11 pro after a year"
"I’ve always been an apple product user and enjoyed them . After my last iPhone iOS update left me with no access to my file folder where my resume of all things is in I called apple . All the reps were friendly and professional but when I was walked through steps to backup wipe out and restore my phone , the rep did NOT tell me to make sure iCloud for photos and files were on . Isn’t this their job ? And even if new isn’t there a script they walk clients through ? I have lost 8000 famiky vacation pics as well as others over years !!! I am speechless. And all they can say was oh well thank you for calling apple care . Really ? No Totally at a loss for words and beyond devastated . I’d give 0 stars if could ."
"Great Customer Service, i have allways been an avid apple user, and have allways experianced the best service and the best products."
"Terrible! Been a Apple user for over 10 years and recently I’m happy to say Samsung and many other are better. No help/support, left to encounter issues with iOS 14. I give up!"
"Poor customer service, my phone was blocked and apple refused to unblock it despite the fact that all documents were presented to them on several occasions.  This included proof of purchase and evidence of order etc. Appears that once the phone is purchased they don't care."
"Seriously?! You autocorrect was better on the 3GS. ☝️I typed in your. You really need to fix this."
"Horrible customer service.  Waiting time is enormous and be prepared to waste all your day solving anything.  They will transfer you from one to another even for a small issue."
"Charged me twice for a repair and we so unhelpful on the phone it was painful."
"I have to admit that iPhones are not that great anymore but I'm still sticking with Apple bc of their customer service"
"The apple Developer customer service is totally useless. Never see any worst service. They didn't provide any help and advice... Please fire some employee and hire real people. Please solve the issues on your developer platform. Best regards, Google user"
"Honestly no longer keeping any Apple products, it’s very ironic how I’ve never had an apple product last me 2 years, clearly a issue on their end, they have greyed out my speaker on my iPhone 7. When I went to get it repaired  they was so eager to tell me about the iPhone SE and tried to sell me that telling me my phone is out of warranty, when in reality they broke it and expect me to buy another iPhone, I’ve been scammed now for 10 years by Apple. Not one of my old Apple phones is able to function or turn on. Finally had enough"
"Poor, tried signing up to an Apple interest free product, but just wouldnt work. Apple said contact Barclays, Barclays says contact Apple. Useless between the pair of them."
"The Poisonous Apple Store Amsterdam It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to sit and write what happened to me with Apple Store Amsterdam. As you all know, I have been what you call an “Appleholic” for more than 13around 12 years, forming lines to get your latest products the day the come out, not only for me, but for my loved ones as well. I have been a fan because your customer service has always been way beyond exceptional, not only in Amsterdam, where I reside, but worldwide. Also, it is widely known that the 2016 Macbook Pro Touch Bar  had a defective  keyboard and was ordered to be replaced. I guess that when the keyboard was changed something was left disconnected and I had to take to a retailer to get it fixed. We noticed that the screen had a crack similar to my dog’s hair. So I decided to take to the computer to the main Apple store in Amsterdam. I talked to a girl who helped me check in my computer to be fixed and then I asked her to please call her manager because I wanted to make a formal a complaint. In comes Christian, who is the General Manager there, and I noticed he was looking at me inappropriately, and I proceeded to give him in the detail all the situation that was happening with my computer, and told him I was going to take responsibility for it (I had already signed all the documents taking full responsibility before talking to him) and I  agreed to paid the repair, which total was near 849 EUR. I wanted to make sure that the issues the computer had and what I had gone throw with it be known by him so I told him I had a recording of the conversation of what the technician at the retailer told me what he thought was going on. Christian, upon hearing this started acting defensively and telling me that I am not allowed to record or take pictures at Apple Amsterdam, yet other customers where doing so. He thought I had recorded him… I also informed him that by law, if I wanted too, I could record anything I want to in the whole country without permission. He hastily decided to delete my complaint that the girl who had assisted me previously had graciously typed in previously. After I left the store I received a call from Christian telling me that he had decided not service my computer. I told him that  my lawyer would get in contact with him and hung up. He kept calling me several times almost to the point that I felt assaulted. My lawyer proceeded to send him a letter to Apple and Christian called my lawyer, and my lawyer had to tell him to calm down because he was too emotional and that in that way would be hard to fix the situation.  After this I contacted Apple Europe on June 2020 and talked to a Jr Manager who understood my situation as very empathetic with me, he gave me a confirmation number for the fixing of my computer and told me that I should be receiving it soon. Well, I did receive an empty box, but with nothing in it. Christian keeps insisting not fixing my computer and has yet to give me my computer back. Keep in mind this has been happening since the end of October 2019. I have lost many projects and thousands of euros in investments because I have had to share someone else’s computer. It is August 2020 and I still don’t have my computer. Christian insisted in acting like a child and completely immature and refuses to fix the computer and because of this principle I need to take Apple to court. I have decided to make my situation public because of the childish behaviour given by the GM of the Apple Amsterdam store who represents this distinguished brand. Oh, and my amazing lawyer, Gerard Geelkerken, one of the top lawyers in Netherlands, will be taking this court because justice needs to be served and we cannot live in a world we’re an immature General Manager decides whether or not discriminating people. So, if you are in the Amsterdam area, and have issues or want to purchase an Apple product, please abstain yourself from going to the Apple store in Amsterdam."
"I am not typically a person to leave reviews but I was extremely disappointed in Apple service today. Before I explain I understand that I hold responsibility for parts is the issues. I ordered three items of clothing from three different websites for my husbands Birthday today using Apple Pay with my credit card. I was not promoted to enter a shipping or billing addressing when using this service. When logging in to check on the status of the delivery I noticed it was shipped (and billed) to the incorrect address. I waited over an hour to talk to a representative from Apple who told me there was nothing she could do to help address the situation and it was my fault. She suggested I call the USPS.I again waited for over an hour with USPS who suggested I would place a parcel intercept form, at $15 each, but found out the items were already delivered to the incorrect address and hopefully would be “returned to sender”. I understand that Apple can not be held responsible for the entire situation but I feel that there should be more checks in place when setting up and using Apple Pay so that this does not happen. I am now without any gifts for my husband on this special day."
"My apple watch when was charging, its battery got swollen so the screen popped off by itself. So I called apple support and explained the case to know what I could do.Long story short...First, the first girl I talked to, was super nice and told me that they would replace it for a new one, because this was a series that it was happening, they said it could harmful for me, so Apple would replace it. I took the watch to an authorized place they told me, they checked the watch and confirmed that it was a swollen battery. Then they told me that I would have to wait 5 business days to have the watch replaced. After about 1 week, I called the place and then they told me I would have to pay to replace the battery (that they told me before they don't replace the batteries) so I called apple to clarify, the guy was very rude and told me it was his ""final answer"" (his words), they wouldn't replace it, I would have to pay for having the battery replaced.Now I got an opened apple watch that they opened saying it was their procedure to confirm the battery was swollen and replace, and will have to pay to fix it anyways..."
"i have been with Apple since the early days of mp3, early days of iphone (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, X, 11 Pro), even bought 2 iPhone 11 Pro for my Children, including 2 Macbook Pros; in total, easily invested >20k on Apple productstoday will be my last day with Apple after the huge disappointing experience:- i had bought the Apple Watch series 4 (metal mash bracelet) >1100 for my wife- the glass was broken, brought it to QCD (Apple appointed service ctr) for repair- was quoted >SGD 620 for repair- whilst apple series 5 costs < SGD 600 to acquire- called Apple support, no workaround solution, either repair at the quoted price or buy newTHIS IS RIDICULOUS!iphones, since Steve J. had left, it has not innovated since X nor 11."
"Apple's market has always been focused towards a specific clientele, which is, namely, the studio-employed, their finesse-at-cost product-design at the sacrifice of overall strength and durability, and it is this need-for-prestige which represents the damaged fuel-gauge, the popularity of their across-the-board slimline appeal to their products running a bit too thin.With Linux and all its accompanying personal-customisation possibilities, 'apps' for cross-platform integration and improved power-management coming to the fore, despite Apple being a product-manufacturer in its own right, could do with rethinking its market-strategy so as to be lapping the field by a wider margin, the lead no doubt largely due to their superior smartphone technology."
"Phoned the call center and they told me I could buy a phone today from the store. Went in I was declined all the way... So I can buy a phone online but not AT the store. I passed the credit check online but not at the store. So 10/10 for the employee who was helpful 0.5/10 for the company."
"Hardware issue in iPhone 6s in 1.5yrs, which become faulty(motherboard) after 18 months. Apple is worst than any local product and very huge price service also not good. They charge 1K per visit if you dont have warranty.This is not only my experience, one of my friend also has iPhone X, which become faulty(Hardware) in just 3 months, since warranty was there he survived. This product was almost 1 lakhs ! Horrible quality & service for such a price."
"Horrible customer service! They tried to sell me a refurbished laptop as new."
"Smart Folio for iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation) - Black £99 RIP OFF!Just over 3 Months old Don’t Buy not fit for purpose what are your views!Apple will not replace or refund.￼￼"
"Was on hold for 30 mins with apple card services just to be hung up on and have to repeat I'm 10 mins into my new hold time and using this time to write as many apple reviews as possible."
"I’ve been a long time apple user because of the practical nature in which they make their products.  I bought an Apple Watch with this same feeling especially since the strap was thread under instead of over making me feel confident it would stay fastened to my arm.     This was not the case!!!!! I was on a jet ski with my brother and when we had a moderate turn that thru me off once I emerged I realized my watch was gone.  Very disappointed in Apple!"
"My original review is below but I'm updating my review. I emailed Tim Cook about the issue and it was resolved that night. I recieved my credit. Original review:I wanted a refund for an Apple band. They said send back watch band and we'll credit your account. Numerous calls later they say they refunded to the wrong card and there's nothing they can do. So now they have my band and my money. I did what they asked and now I don't get my money back. Absolutely horrible!!!"
"All I can say is horrible!!! I’ve been told three different things by three different representative and no one has a solution. I don’t even have the energy to write a review about what is really going, but what I will say is do not order from Apple.com!!! Please do not!! Oh and don’t dare have to return something. Once again it’s horrible!!! I am disputing a transaction for $791.80 and filing a report!!"
"Apple and google map are not honest to the ordinary people,iPhone maps in uk designed poorly,some time to reach to your destination you need only one bus but iphone shows two or three bus because they algorithm with Uk transport is to make money as much they can from ordinary people and from those older people who cannot use their phone properly ,iPhone system also is not like how the Americans propaganda showing ,Iphone have many weak point some times you cannot copy your own writing words with your new iPhone,only a good camera it is good camera because the other phones cameras which undercover owned by the same people to mislead people and creat competations of buying is not fine,we live in a bad world with a very bad people,change and reforms are essential and not doing that is dangerous for all and for the universe and the existence"
"Placed an order on the 3rd of July, never received the item and still waiting on refund. Keep getting told I need to wait 3 days for refund but its not happened."
"My iMac came really fast (next day) to San Jose. 10/10"
"I recently had trouble with my apple, and contacted the help. They were very professional and helped to clean out my computer for me. Kudos to Apple!"
"I have an Android and an Apple, I just got them both, so I do not know how to use them, I looked it up...: When you have a problem with your Android phone, you can try online forums or calling your carrier. But with the iPhone, you can tap into a vast database of useful help articles on Apple's website, get help via live chat, or you can schedule an appointment at an Apple Store Genius Bar. Google doesn't have this kind of direct relationship with its customers. With Android, you’re on your own."
"We have gone through three Iphone 8's all new ""out the box"" with the same problem, ""cannot hear phone calls through the phones ear speaker/receiver"". Multiple calls to Apple Care Technicians (and many hours later) did not fix the phone. Finally Apple Care Support Supervisor Jennifer (from MN) blamed the issue on AT&T. Frustrated with Apple we paid AT&T extra and upgraded early to a new Iphone XR. Guess what Apple, XR NO PROBLEM. Very disappointed in Apple's support and response."
"My EXPENSIVE IPHONE LOST ALL MY DATA! Don't Buy IphoneOne week ago my phone stopped working due to apple software issues, after going to Apple store and calling them they proposed me 150$ or 1000$ data extraction cost through external parties. Apple made me loose all my not backed up data (to back-up i need to pay for their cloud considering their devices are always out of space). I am disappointed for paying high premium price for their device and receiving the worst service and loosing my data (not even Nokia 3310 had these issues). The apple store didn't even provide a solution for my not working device (e.g. giving a substitute phone) but they proposed me to buy a new phone and have a small discount giving back mine. I refuse to buy Iphone again: I will go to Chinese/Asian competition (Samsung, Huawei etc.)"
"CASE NUMBER:101134701464. I have been trying to communicate from the 18 June 2020 to maker payments. THIS IS MORE THEN A MONTH AGO AND MY PAYMENTS WAS DECLINE.I have used 3 logings and different credit cards AND BANKS. The last one is  a login with a friends credentials and his credit cards details that he himself put in. He is in the import and export business and he is using this same credit card to make overseas payments in dollars and in Euros. With his credit card should be no problems. IT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK FOR APPLE TO RESPOND TO MY EMAILS. and all they say that they will conduct an internal inquiry.  Almost 2 months. poor service. Pathetic. Cannot phone as the answer machine gives an email address. Just poor and pathetic services."
"Worst product ever Since 2008 using Apple iPhone and iPad but currently things changed and product’s quality became very bad and expensive also products every times will need a spare parts which also very expensive,Currently had iPhone XS since 14 Months and now speaker not working and went to Apple store and they request for 1100 dirhams to solve the issue which almost 30% of phone priceDidn’t know what to do"
"It cost already a lot and after you have to buy about 2-3 chargers every month. Apart for the fact that is very resistant is the worst phone ever.In addition is not just expensive but all the accessories cost more than you can imagine and they don't have nothing that could justify the price.Nor recommended, don't buy it ."
"I was told I would be refunded for a $50 charge my son made without permission that didn’t go through. I told the guy helping that my son should of never even done that and to just take the charge off. I was told he couldn’t and it would have to be cleared before he could update my card information for my Apple Care since the original card was about to be deactivated but we could put in a refund. I wanted to update my Apple Care because of a bad experience before with Apple where my iPhone 7 stopped working because of a recall that they supposedly fixed two years before that caused the same problem but when I took it back to be fixed again I’m told oh well that recall has expired so you’ll have to buy a new phone. I have to buy a new phone because your product stopped working again because of YOUR defect that you’ve acknowledged and repaired before. I was told when I bought the new phone that as long as I paid for my Apple Care every month they would fix or replace my phone even past the two year mark which is good because I take care of my phones and I’m not replacing an almost $1000 phone every two years. So I wanted to make sure my Apple care wasn’t interrupted because Apple has shown to be shady before. That is why I even cleared the charge to begin with. Hindsight I should of waited and let the charge fall off after they saw hey we’re probably not getting this money. It’s not like my son was using what he charged during the pending charge state. It’s ridiculous they can’t cancel a charge that they’re being told shouldn’t of happened anyway. So I clear the charge just for the refund to be denied. Talked to 5 different representatives including a manager just to be told well he shouldn’t of said that but it’s nothing we can do. We can’t refund it. So I was tricked into paying for this $50 charge just to not be refunded like I should of and the solutions being I’ll track down the guy who helped you at first so he can be better educated like his education helps me with the $50. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and this is how Apple handles mistakes by their representatives. I have quite a bit invested in Apple with my iPhone 8, my son’s iPhone 7 and my MacBook Air but I’m definitely done with investing my money in this company. It’s too much money for such shady business."
"Purchased Laptop in April 15.Laptop Arrived May 18.Was ill and opened laptop May 20.Laptop is broken and has sound issues. Contact Apple to request a replacement. May 25 They suggest a repair.I send the laptop in, they repair the laptop, it comes back still broken.I ask to get a replacement they said it cannot be done because I missed the 14 day mark to ask for a replacement...I said I did ask for a replacement. They said I was talking to the wrong team, I should have spoken to Sales in order to ask for a replacement. It's been 4 months. I still don't have a functioning laptop, or a replacement, and in order to speak to a manager, it is a 14 day hold , while on escalation...Never. ever. ever. ever. ever. in 10 million years purchasing or supporting, or investing in anything Apple ever again."
"Do not buy an Apple product specially the new iPhone they don't last long Apple not doing anything for my replacement iPhone. Xr The phone is defective and they want to give me a refurbished iPhone and now for the next year-and-a-half I have to pay off this phone I will no longer buy an Apple product never again your guys's customer service sucks monkey crap $700 and I put insurance on this phone and apple if not doing anything about it when I ask to speak to customer relation she told me I'm the highest one they don't want to help you they don't want to do anything they don't care about their customers I'd long after getting the money from the phone they don't care about the customers they will do great when you buy an iPhone and they will help you out every time when you go to the office though no one wants to help you these new iPhones don't last long I really hate apple apple should be shut down my phone is getting a lot of drop calls delays text messages slow LTE and all Apple wants to do is yell at yell at me and apple is not the same company where Steve Job died Apple.

"Number one Scammer company in world.I requested Apple for assistance to access my Hard drive as there is lock showing there I used the code I created but it doesnt work. Apple take joy to slow down and kill your Apple device that you paid a lot money for so you can buy new items from them. I wrote to the Federal state in the USA and the EU commission for assistance as the item is mine and the data on the Hard drive are my private date therefore affecting my privacy and rights."
"I purchased the MacBook Air which works great but it was supposed to come with a set of free charging case AirPods. The package showed up without the AirPods, I contacted customer service via chat support and they said they added the AirPods on and I'd have an order number show up in 10 days or less (see attached screenshot), well the order number never came so I contacted support today and they are saying I have to RETURN my MacBook Air and repurchase it to get the AirPods now. I'm EXTREMELY frustrated at this point with Apple. I want to buy the computers for my business but if this is how customer service works then I'm not down with it. I asked for a manager to talk to and they said it could be 14 BUSINESS DAYS for a call back which is crazy."
"Dreadful customer service, they purposely make if difficult to return anything, I spoke with marianna who’s was in Greece, yesterday, today I’m talking to leanna who is in Albania, she doesn’t know who marianna is or how to contact he. This is a major firm who record your calls, log everything yet can’t seem to communicate internally. Every time I have had to contact them it has taken over an hour on the phone. It’s amazing you can buy a phone from them in ten minutes, but you get a problem it takes hours. Why? Because they don’t care once they have your money that’s why."
"Really dull company and appalling customer service at all levels.I purchased an IPhoneSE direct from Apple online. It arrived as promised however was broken with the casing detached. Had to jump through several hoops to get it returned to have it exchanged.Then “ radio silence “ from Apple. Contacted them, on hold for 45 mins and then advised their had been an error. I asked to speak to a manager.....still waiting."
"Never know a company like it put a complaint in last April and still nothing been done was told to write to Ireland which i did to then get some one who was rude no help what so every emailed CEO contacted them on other site emails ignored purchased a phone that is faulty and they wont do anything about it. Shocking"
"Bought new iMac, easy to order, excellent speedy delivery. Easy set up. Very happy."
"Absolutely rubbish customer service.....Bought iPad Pro and given a 3-4 week delivery estimate. It was for a birthday present so wrote to customer services to see if the earlier of the week window could be met. First response, we can’t help try store, 2nd response, we can’t help “wrap an empty box if it doesn’t arrive” 3rd response the day before it was due “sorry nothing in the system once it ships you’ll get a note” and we can’t change to Saturday delivery. Apple do not care about the customer they take your money and run! Arrogant."
"Just saw Technician Brandon at the Apple Store in the Summit Mall,Akron, OH. Brandon was exceptional and very informative at answering all our questions. If I ever have to go back to that store I will definitely request to see him again."
"I hate Apple. iPhone simply stopped working - they told me it was a hardware issue (theirs) however I was required to pay over 500 pounds to replace. What??? I have to pay for YOUR HARDWARE ISSUE. I hate Apple."
"I am glad I bought my iPhone 11. At first I was hesitant to buy it. Much better than a Samsung in my opinion. Will buy one for my husband as an early birthday present."
"I bought a $2500 McBook pro in September. In April the Touch Bar stopped working. I have tried to get a repair/replacement. Apple said I have to either drop it off at a Apple Store (I live in Texas, all are closed) or send it to CA. I can't do that because it is my only computer to work with and I have active files on it that need daily attention. I even tried to call all apple certified repair stores within a radius of 60 miles around me. Everything is closed. I filed a complaint with BBB. Apple considers this a not worth complaint to help a client. The case was closed by them without a solution. I will loose my warranty and be stuck with a pice of junk."
"I have been trying to cancel a $7.90 monthly bill paid out of my deceased partner's VISA account since last year. He died on October 10th. 2019. I sent them a copy of the Death Certificate. My partner died without giving me any of his passwords. He was ill for many months before he died and could not remember them. He dealt with all of his bills electronically. I was unable to see any of his transactions and had to get the Bank Manager's help in making sure all bills were paid where they would affect me. You refused to cancel this account stating I needed a COURT ORDER to allow for me to do this. This is insane. Now we are having to deal with this VIRUS this is impossible to handle. Not only do you handle grieving disabled senior customers poorly but you take their money when it is illegal to do so. This man is deceased and you are still collecting money for services and equipment no longer in my/his possession. Shame on you."
"The most scamming con artist company I ever come across in my life is Apple, no one wonder they always sue Samsung because they're own products are just crap and they always try to trap the consumer in any way they can, to me Huawei is Apple's Daddy of Daddys, no wonder they're so jealous of Huawei and using a President to try get sales, how low can you get as a company lol wow, how on earth is Apple even operating when it's a known fact they are a scamming company?"
"Tried replacing my iPhone 11 that has Apple care and had a horrible experience and also got my money removed from my account several times. Am STILL having a hard time getting everything settled."
"I bought a iPad Pro last February and it died 2 months ago, I’ve tried calling, sending it in for repair being it’s still under warranty and still making payments. I can’t get any help to resolve this issue. For the money they charge for their product you would think they would give you something other then an impersonal computer to talk to that only sends you to some tech person in India that doesn’t understand English."
"I purchased an IPhone 7 not ever being informed by Apple that there was a manufacturing defect with the IPhone 7. Only after experiencing the inability to receive or make calls. After extensive research I realized that this was due to the fact that the Apple software install update did not completely update. I have experienced this with my IPhone three times in the past one and a half months. I just got off a call with Cody in the IT Dept who confirmed that Apple has been aware of the issue and had not been proactive by making the consumer aware of the issues with these phones prior to purchase, but instead is being reactive by offering to inconvenience the customer by waiting 7 days for a box to arrive to put your IPhone into and ship to Apple for repair with NO ETA. Cody states there are No Exceptions...Apple Does Not offer you Any customer a Replacement. Apple ONLY offers ALL customers a repair with NO ETA and although it is an error on their part and inconvenienced their customers, they will Not Rush a phone No matter the NEED in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic and the fact that people need their phones to do their job and this can negatively impact their customers. When I requested to speak with Cody‘ Supervisor  (who is a supervisor for Apple)  He stated that there was only Upper Management and they aren’t bothered with customer complaints and they Do Not speak with their customers. He refused to let me speak with His Supervisor or provide me with the info to submit a complaint or dissatisfaction with Apple regarding the the fact they are Not providing first call resolution or their horrible service , and selling of bad product."
"Excellent quality, I am happy with my purchase. My new MacBook Pro is great, very fast and I love the design. Ordering online was easy."
"I purchased an iPhone 7 in 2016 and have had to replace it FIVE times because of issues connecting to a service provider. Apple claims to have had a fix for it since 2018, however, I am experiencing the same issue again in 2020 to the point that I can't use at ever, which is especially inconvenient since I work from home now because of the coronavirus pandemic. I am absolutely disappointed in Apple for making a product that doesn't work and has caused me to spend so much time repairing this issue. The customer support has always been friendly, but never helpful since I always end up being sent to the Apple store over an hour away in each direction for a replacement, which I then have to setup all over again. I've spent five hours today alone trying to setup an appointment to have ANOTHER replacement, but never got a call back from Apple despite the fifteen minute wait time."
"im loving my apple purchases reently. gone back to apple after a few years on android and i am enjoying it alot. Especially the ease of use with the apple watch for exercising and sleep, heart rate etc etc"
"Weekend With No MoneyI purchased an apple watch two days ago, after receiving the product I noticed I was charged twice the day after. I am currently spending the rest of this weekend and I can only imagine a good portion of next week with no money remaining in my checking account.  This has happened to me twice. Apple doesn't make a mistake in charging me twice but I have not seen them ship a product twice by mistake. Please fix this problem of double charging, I'm guessing your global revenues are able to pay your bills effectively and you don't need to double charge me in order to make it. Of course I'm not sure how I am going to make it with no money for food and no options available because my account is overdrawn."
"So called senior manager (Steve Dell) himself is behaving pathetic and arrogant way, what else you can expect from his employees. Other girl ""Busher"" was lost as well. I kept explaining about problem in IPhone 7, I had multiple issues with  my unit like Reception, charging port was filled with ash one day but I had to clean, so that I can start my phone (for this I took that damaged charging wire to apple too, which nobody bothered to look) other problems Mic,. Now unfortunately their diagnose shows it has stereo output issue, which they said they will change screen. So problem here is that warranty will expire in next month plus I have seen charging port filled with ash, what if this phone starts fire in my house?  Now that girl was unable to help because she kept asking same questions ten time, I said I would like to see manager to keep it short as of Covid 19 issue. I ask manager i am 200% sure that charging port has issue and I always face issues at home, he kept saying one thing in arrogant way that we can only replace screen and for reception they told me you might be turning DO NOT DISTURB, which I am not because me and wife are well aware of this Option.So end of the story I have no proof of problems I was facing in physical form. He was diagnosing something else with his device. They never listen to my issues or might be thinking that i am trying to scam new phone from them. But I can't risk bringing that phone and charging in my house now anymore. So last I ask manager to keep phone there and try this with any employee or tech and whenever they trust my issues, they can send me other phone or repair all issues. Now on this manager said that we have note and even warranty expire we will try to look into it. I asked how long your note and your words are valid, so that I know clearly and avoid argument in future and he replied "" i can't give you time"". In the last I left wire and iPhone 7 on the table and told them to just keep it. He rudely again said, “you can't leave this on our table"". I was trying to avoid making scene and shouting there. But this guy frustrated me that much I asked him, if I can't leave my phone on table because you guys are not repairing it, do you want me to throw in your ""GARBAGE BIN"", he said ""OK GO AHEAD"". In the end I dumped my phone and left the store. Now I noticed I forgot to take representative name, I ask the lady at front and this manager rush to me and showing attitude, ""Oh I am happy to give you my visiting card"".I was using these apple products from years, not only on this ID, but after this encounter after taking my backup back I am deleting my whole ID's and Dumping all apple product in Garbage and will make video and will send it to social media with video and this interaction story. Because even you have issue with the product they won’t admit or try to deny them which make people look stupid.This is a legit review, my case id was: 101133112170.One more thing I have noticed today after one day of this happening, before they were sending me that charging wire replacement and replacement for headphone when I called them and told them they are not working fine and it’s so funny this manager or apple stopped that transaction and started asking for money for those replacements. This is legit issue too, Repair ID's: D462128394, D462122472. Note my IPhone is 10.5 month old and they are behaving like this. Maybe they thought customer is gone anyways, who gives a s**t anymore. I bet it’s not one customer. Already in my family I have multiple users which are getting rid of their services shortly and I will share my interaction everywhere possible."
"Poor quality, over priced and terrible customer service. Stay away and go to Samsung instead!"
"Well I’ve been trying to put my card into my Apple ID or whatever and it’s not letting me it keeps on saying it’s declined or it can’t be put in and it’s charging me $17 for something I didn’t buy twice and I don’t know who to call because someone told me that Apple is closed and I called my bank and they don’t even know why it’s not working"
"Do not buy an I mac. They have no availability if the machine goes wrong and it will go wrong trust me as we have a few and all have needed new hard drives. I am a Vulnerable customer and they can't collect the machine and expect me to deal with the fact they have no repair centres. I told the advisor lewis the service was a disgrace and he said that he does not appreciate that kind of language and put the phone down. So i am left with a faulty machine and no way of having the rubbish repaired. Good old apple once again you have let us down."
"16 minute wait on the phone, after I explained the problem with my ipad pro (after I spent 15 min on hold with my internet provider and chase down the authorized dealer since apple stores are closed due to covid), her response was to escalate to a supervisor who would call me exactly at a specified time, which he/she did not! I finally called back the internet provider, and we figured out that the authorized dealer did not remove the SIM card when taking my smashed ipad pro for a refurbished replacement, so my sim card is out there somewhere. Very sloppy! Took me an entire day, and I ended up solving the problem myself."
"I bought a new iMac on 27 March this year so that I could provide remote online learning for all my students ( I am a secondary school teacher). After trying to restart the first time after I’d received it and set it up,the logicboard failed and I had to take it back into an Apple store to be repaired (at my own cost!) it’s now 30th May and I am still without my machine. Apple has my money and I have no machine - my students have also had no teaching for 2 months. Frankly unacceptable."
"Worst customer service! I made a purchase on the 26th June and was due to get it 9th July. It didn’t arrive on the 9th so I tried to call Apple and although they were all polite they refused to help in any way? I practically had to force them to contact UPS and check the status. They eventually opened an investigation to locate the package and even though they agree that the item was never delivered to me, they are forcing me to wait until UPS admits loss/resends the item before I get a refund?! How is this fair?"
"2 Factor Authentification on. Strong password yet was still charged for something I didn't purchase. No kids no one else who would of used my phone. The order was made at 1AM whilst I was asleep. I go to request a refund through paypal and they refuse to help becuase it was a pre-approved payment. Request a refund through apple and I can't even select the item I want a refund on because it's not there they just charged me for something. £0.79 a month for icloud. Go on iCloud and I don't have the paid version so they have literally scammed me out of my money.I know some will say it's only £0.79 but they took it out just before my rent was due to come out and then my rent failed. I shouldn't have to do this because so scammers in suits in the USA pretend they are a legitimate company while scamming people out of money. Also PAY YOUR TAX APPLE you FRAUDS."
"I have always though of Apple providing great customer service and took the plunge to switch from Andriod to iPhone. A decision I have since regretted and after spending nearly 45 minutes on the phone to their customer service department to sort out a problem with a pair or earpods which broke on the first day. Awful service and a complete waste of time. If you are considering buying Apple based on what you think will be quality products and great customer service think again."
"im putting this rating only because the phones are ridiculously expensive"
"Absolutely disgusted with Apple! For the last 6 months they have been over charging me and are now refusing to give me a refund on the money they over charged me because “I should have noticed earlier” Such a disgusting company! Have been with Apple since the iPhone 3 and now have the iPhone 11 and this is how you treat your customers! You’re “senior sales advisor” is absolutely horrible. You have that much money behind you yet you still feel the need to over charge people and when said people do find out you refuse to refund! I’m appalled."
"Apple, you guys are a complete joke, found a current bogus charge on my account which was reoccurring monthly, just happened to see it, was on the phone for 45 min then disconnected, waited another 45 min and was told they would only consider refunding me for 2 months, that was their company policy, come on apple!!! I will never buy anything apple related ever again!!!"
"I was not surprised to see that they have 1.2 stars. I have been getting the runaround for the last three days. I have always loved iPhones I actually went to an android But preferred the iPhone so I got another iPhone. I have had my phone for about a little over A year. My son was playing with my phone and it locked me out. I restored it and as I went to set it up again it told me that I needed my iCloud ID and password. It was signed in on that phone but I did not sign on anywhere else so I had forgot it. Trying to reset it it sent a passcode to my phone but I can’t get into my phone without sign into my iCloud. It went into recovery mode and told me it would take 24 hours I spoke with someone to ask if there was anything else possible I could do they told me I had To wait. So I did I went to 24 hours I went to try to sign on to see what the status was of my recovery and it stated I had to wait 13 days to reset my password. So right now I can’t get into my phone because I have to get into my iCloud. So I called again and once again they gave me a run around. They told me they would send me an email where I could submit my proof of purchase and it would take about three days. I received the email I follow the prompts Stated I needed to sign into my iCloud. I CAN NOT GET INTO MY PHONE OR MY ICLOUD!!!!! Now I am having to wait 13 days to be able to use my phone. My husband works out of town and we don’t have a house phone and I don’t live near any of my family. This is the dumbest ignorant  thing I have ever had to go through in my life. So once I am done to try to figure out how the hell I’m gonna be able to do this I will no longer buy an Apple product in my life And I will also write on every single overview page so that other people don’t get suckered in to buying an Apple product."
"Apple Trade In - sent in my old phone expecting a £55 refund. Two weeks later get an email saying that the backlight is not working properly and so they revised their estimate from £50 (no idea why they changed the estimated refund value) to £0. There was nothing wrong with the phone, it’s feels like a scam to get your old phones for nothing. I’ve asked for my phone to be returned to me - I’d rather give it to charity than have this large organisation take it for nothing.  Trade-ins via Apple are misleading."
"Great phones and apps. Not much support unless you pay some ridiculous fee. Should have a better customer care plan considering the amount of money people spend on their products. Bit cheeky if u ask me"
"I absolutely love my new MacBook Air, amazing quality, very fast and easy to order on the Apple website."
"Apple has had my phone for over a month and management support management is an buttholes they lie they can’t even tell you when the stores going to open to get your device back. They are basically STEALING APPLE PRODUCTS FROM CUSTOMERS DURING COVID-19 because you take your device for repair and they shut the store down without a reopen date and don’t communicate then get offended when you snap"
"I don't even know where to begin?  It started a week ago at the Coquitlam Store (British Columbia).... and then a series of events.  The poorest customer service I have ever in my life experienced!  Wrong information - give them $1,000 over the phone with Credit card and then I show up and they have no scheduled appointment.  Send me away for 2 hours and a rude, disrespectful manager (Steven) at this store...with a smug look on his face then says ""well, you don't have to be here"".  Appalled!  Disgusted!  I could go on and on....but they've already taken up too much of my precious time.  They are not worth it!  No wonder some of my friends keep their Androids!"
"Woke up this morning to see a 2nd charge on my card for Apple care. Was meant to go to Manchester today but now am unable to hire a car due to this additional charge. 4 hrs later Apple tried to charge for the laptop again £5499! They blame the bank and the bank blame Apple, they say apple pre authorised the payment but then didn’t claim the payment and left the funds in limbo. The bank can’t release it without something in writing from Apple. Apple say they have to use the method of authorising a payment at the point of purchase then charging when shipped because they get a lot of cancellations. I find that hard to believe, they are penalising customers that don’t cancel there orders over customers that do?? After spending several hrs on the phone to Apple / bank and even going to Apple store no solutions just a total mess! They have blocked money on account and tried to take both payments for MBP & Care twice. I am now loosing this shoot in Manchester tomorrow and feel like Apple don’t care.The store Manager said he can’t do anything, phone support are just as powerless and are messing with my work and am loosing this job! I asked Apple for something written and they said due to security they cannot. I know Payment systems are pretty confusing at the best of times but this is so utterly ridiculous."
"Apple cell phone support is a scam and not practical to considered to be called professional support.  My phone is completely inoperable now with on going bs support from chat support. My phone is 6 months old and has 9+ on going problems with it.  The non-verbal chat support is not supported by a true to life person but a computer that can see what your are typing before you send it to them.  Scam all the way. Beware"
"I sent iPhone 7 to repair centre in the post due to its battery issues as the shops here in England were shut due to covid 19. We posted it to the address in England in the box and postage bag they sent. They claimed that they received the iPhone with damaged screen and wouldn’t touch it until we pay for the repair of the screen - they asked for over £150 for it. The screen was not damaged when we sent it so it must have got damaged either in the post or by the repair centre. Despite of complaining to them and even writing to Mr Tim Cook in US twice, they didn’t really care and disowned the responsibility of this damage and wouldn’t touch the phone for the initial reason it was sent for. I only found out when they posted it back that it went to Czech Republic repair centre which created even more doubts for me.Apple support care is PATHETIC, SICKENING, HORRIBLE AND BRUTAL. After using several Apple products for years I have lost my trust completely on this company given how unprofessionally they dealt with my case. I would not recommend Apple to anyone. They are total rip offs and don’t care for their customers at all. Thanks."
"Definitely no recommend AirPod at all I just got them and don’t have I’ve a moth and they have a lot Issue so toke the store and they don’t I’ve want to changed and Or money back nothing no recommend buy the AirPod I’ve I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max and still doesn’t work so being call Apple and they don’t do nothing to help me about. So if you don’t want to waist 300 dollar in that don’t do it customer service sucks bad they don’t care nothing about you jus want the money"
"Just 13 days back I bought a Apple MacBook Pro 13” . After 10 days it suddenly stopped functioning and was totally dead . The service centre told it is manufacturing defect and the logical mother board needs to be replaced. They are not sure how long it will take to be repaired. Apple is totally absolving themselves after selling a defective costly product , they are neither replacing it nor refunding money . This is totally unfair business practice which is evidenced by Apple has no email address where you can communicate. Think twice before purchasing Apple product."
"Bought Apple AirPods because of the hype. Died after 5 months of use (I may add not very constant use because having them in my ears for over half an hour a day gave me a headache although that’s my problem not theirs). Started cutting out after 3 months but I let them run their course. 150 pounds is so unrealistic for such an unreliable product. Much better option is using the wired ones and not caring if you look old fashioned- they actually last and occasionally stop your phone from getting smashed when it falls out of your pocket. AirPods are not worth it."
"Love apple 11 pro max waiting for iPhone 12"
"I ordered a Apple Mac Pro Lap Top it cost me 3300 pound ,Apple said it was delivered by U.P.S I said I had not received it and where was it delivered to and what proof ,No picture was taken and no signature was taken just a investigation by the courier to say it was successful,Apple now said it’s a police matter and I’ve been the victim of a crime ,No sorry Apple you have been a victim of crime your just passing the hedache over to me ,Can’t believe it"
"Hey guys I’m here to speak on the Apple AirPods Pro! These things do not stay in your ears! Period! Waste of money! Don’t waste your time and money on these. I have had them pop out of my ears in the strangest places like into my toilet bowl my kitchen sink while washing dishes in the streets while walking across a busy road. They are just not worth it! I’m looking for a pair of beats right now! 400.00 wasted! All they do is sit in the case."
"Would give Apple a no star rating if there was a option. Spent thousands on a phone that doesn’t work properly Apple are a sc#m. Had to get a new phone because Apple made my older phone crash, got 2 new iPhone 11 pros and now having operating issues and the only way to resolve this issue is to lose all my important data which cannot be saved any other way to the phones issue. Complete joke good one apple. Customer service is just as bad with help."
"I would rate it 0 but you have to rate it at least one!Very poor service Tried to schedule calls for support.Initially sent automated response saying we tried to call you but could not reach when there was no attempt to call.Later got a call back but instead of some agent got a muffled automated response Tried rescheduling and contacting again, no responseVery poor service"
"For last 3 months trying to reset my password,with no success.tried hundred time and over .they said they will call me back ,they never do.i am frustrated .next time i will buy either Japanese or Chinese phones  phones"
"Wish I could make it a half star or none can’t tell if it’s crappy apple or just review system, device wont connect half the time freezes up and Has trouble operating in areas that even have 4 bars even now is glitching out can’t see what I’m typing so for any one on google stick with it I wish I would have"
"I bought my I phone x-max a year ago and suddenly it would not charge at all. So I sent the phone to apple and they said that they denied repair, because my phone was tampered with. I am 100%sure that I did not do anything with my phone I talked with the apple and they said it had been tampered with so how do you prove that the phone hasn't been tampered? It seems so lame that they will deny repair that way."
"I’m been on hold for 2 hours to speak to supervisor who’s very unprofessional and doesn’t know what she’s doing period!Wasting my time for nothing. I can’t believe it the worst customer service and experience with apple online. For this reason I will never purchase any Apple products anymore period. I don’t need to deal with them anymore!!!"
"Every time I try to deal with Apple or any device that has to do with Apple's account, etc... I end up spending half the day trying just to login. Someone needs to pick the ball up and fix this! #MakeItUser-friendly! #Go-Android👍"
"worst customer support, calling and emailing for activation lock that didn't get support and didn't get to process faster and were told the process would take 2 or 3 days to fix, now it's almost 5 months that still my phone is on activation lock."
"Worse customer service I have ever experienced.  2 hour hold.. senior adviser Duante absolute joker"
"Apple got bad service. Been holding on the phone for 2 hours with bad bad customer service. Dissatisfied customer"
"I bought a new Mac book pro, I have a older version and planned to upgrade, I checked the trade in value and it was 480$, the old laptop was in excellent condition but I figured 480$ and saving the hassle of seeking may be worth it, I paid in full for the new laptop and received a box for the old one, I sent the old PC and within a week I was notified that they will only pay 170$, I was so frustrated I click accept vs. reject, I called Apple support 10 minutes later and they said there is nothing they can do, they then referred me to the company handling the trade in, I called them, they said they will handle it the next day as it was end of day, I called 6:00AM the next day, and that company said there is nothing they can do, I called Apple and they offered me 140$ (On top of the 170$) which I refused and asked for my laptop back, Apple refused to oblige, I will never buy Apple products again. I could easily get $800 for my mid 2015 MAC Pro and due to Apple received 170$ for it"
"It has taken me 6 months and a court case to get a refund from Apple for money they took for a keyboard which was replaced under warranty. Is that not theft?  They CS communications are awful, I spent ¾ hour on the phone after which I was promised a refund.  This never happened. Found an email address but they refused to reply, just asked me to speak on the phone but I wanted a written record. I emailed Tim Cook direct a number of times but, unsurprisingly, got no response. Eventually I took them to court (UK) and obtained a decree against Apple. They then refunded me but refused compensation and refused an apology. They really do not care once they have your money, if they did they wouldn't get such poor reviews."
"Whatever you do, DON’T SUBSCRIBE TO APPLECARE!  I have had two serious issues, and they’ve both been ‘escalated’ to engineering.  One was on December 26, 2019 and the more recent was in May of this year.  To date, nothing has been done.  I’ve owned Apple products for twenty years, but no more!"
"Horrible customer service. I just waited for nearly an hour on hold to take to a representative to fix what should be a simple issue of being locked out of my account. The girl asked a couple questions, basically said she didn't know what to do and that there may not be a solution at all and then stuck me on old for another twenty minutes or so (without ever checking in) until the call dropped. This isn't the first time I've had unfortunate experiences with Apple, including customer service and their products. I've found Samsung (and most Android companies products and services) to typically be far better to deal with, and far more societally productive than Apple. If Apple works for you than that's great, but I absolutely recommend getting out of the hype and peer pressure of Apple and discovering which Android phone is best for you (OnePlus, Google, Samsung, LG, etc)."
"Fixed my screen within good(ish) time.  Thanks"
"I have booked to repair my apple laptop with Apple by paying £ 476.40 on 23rd June 2020. I have then sent me a box, so I can pack and send it with their carrier company. It was sent out of country to their repair centre. Then I have received an e-mail on 26th stating product received and follow up e-mail on 3rd July 2020 stating your request complete and product being shipped back and they are charging me. I have received the box today on 6th July and with a fancy note stating the laptop was not fixed, because repair would cost more than I am paying and needed my authorization. I have never received e-mail or call.I have spoken to Apply today who are thinking they are right beyond anything, telling me they sent 3 e-mails and it was my fault for not replying. I have received 5 other e-mails but not these three, claiming they sent but it must be my e-mail provider or something, but not apple.They have suggested I should re-send it. I have requested how much it will costs as they have seen the product, but they could not tell me this. They can only tell if I send again. So, one time wasting is not enough and I have to go through again."
"iPhone 7 has problems with microphone since I can only use it with ear plugs. Have called help for service since April. Then tried to visit stores where only interest is shown by agents for purchases. With this parade mic  Apple is trying to monopolize their newer models to sell and will not help to debug their older models. Infact the problem occurred after I did a iOS update. What kind of an American enterprise is this. Should be putout of business instead of receiving the government reduced taxes. Totally disgusted.  I had great service with my Samsung cellphone but my children convinced me with a iPhone to communicate via face time."
"I require an apple Xr iphone manual as there was nothing included when I bought one recently -  it is hard  to see anywhere I can get one to print free-  without having to sign up to pay 23.90 per month - How Come this Yank Company or the agent where I got mine is allowed to sell them without any instructions one can actually read especially about setting a NORMAL voice mail  ( NOT VISUAL)   ?"
"Absolutely garbage customer service. I've been trying to access my account for a few days now; just sat on hold for an hour while they tried to transfer to another department. Then they just hung up on me. Repeat x2 and still not in my account. They're continuing to charge me for services through the app store and haven't been able to get access to stop payment despite my requests to cancel my services. Sure that's illegal @ fair trade Australia? I just bought a new phone today so trying to move my information over; spent so much on apply products and services."
"apple is a wonderfull company to buy all sort and everything works perfectly.I would recommend you to buy stuff at apple"
"MacBook Pro 13inch 2020 This is a overrated and overpriced piece of junk. Take my advice and save your money. I bought it to use in conjunction with my iPads I own. Sadly there is a gulf of difference between the two in performance and the cost.Buy a windows pc and save your money and an iPad and don’t be taken in by this overpriced and overrated piece of junk."
"Why doesn’t apple have anything to do with India they have a apple store but they only have the SE that it really in the service there is terrible why can’t you help them send a International satellite no matter what we still have to pay for International but do it for very one think how much money you well get"
"8 times out of 10 I have not had a problem with Apple. The shop is always busy. I have never understood why there are no tills it is confusing, suppose it is for more security.  Apple products themselves - always had a iPhone and iPod. iPhone batteries only last for 2 years if that, they slowly die. I do not use my iPod as frequent as my phone but they are good. There is only 1 thing I hate about apple which is the iCloud; you only get 5GB free before you have to buy. 5GB is not practical as it gets used really quick."
"I bought an iPad PRo advertised as the next computer, which has proven to be a huge overstatement. The iPad is difficult to use for anything more than playing games. It is nearly impossible to use it for word processing or any other business activity. I am so disappointed in this product. I strongly discourage others from buying it."
"Apple worst experience ever.please don't waste your time and money.feels good at first..but lasts as ,long as long the warranty, then its crap updates that means new devices to cope with the new software..means more money out your pocket.Every two seconds there's something thats failing, might be just the way you use most it apple lovers will say. Battery's don't last long, Apple lovers will say you over charged them thats not true they are just crap.All devices are brilliant to start then about 3 years life to they end up in a draw collecting dust because they are not compatible to the latest update (usually after the tech support has run out ) money grabbing TW*T's.I say this as a ex Apple lover for 14 years."
"Can’t say enough good things about Apple service. Had a drama with my iPhone X ghost screen etc. I called them on Saturday and received my phone back this afternoon (Friday) all fixed. Really impressed thank you very much."
"I had a problem with a payment being made through PayPal for a subscription I hadn’t requested.  I contacted Apple Support by email explaining the circumstances & within a very short time, I got a reply from Abigail.  She said she was looking into this & would get back to me.  Within an hour, she had sorted things out & arranged a refund.  Very, very impressed by the service & support from Abigail from Apple.  Well done & thank you."
"I just want to say that after having a great number of iPhones over the years, I am sick to death of my iPhone X.  I have had two replacements via my insurance company (as Apple weren't interested), two had very temperamental charging socket issues and two of them have Face ID that works and then doesn't.  I really look after my phones and now, the screen glass has just come loose.  Apple down want to know about any of these issues. Up to them. Time to talk with my feet..."
"just poor, first they sent me an ipad pro which is deffective, now making me wait for 6weeks for a new one wow could’ve just given me 6weeks wait in the first place so wouldnt have order! already opened the magic keyboard so can’t get a refund coz will be a big loss 😒"
"Apple has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.My 1.5 year old 2018 MacBook Air randomly died on me without me dropping it or anything so I went to the Genius Bar to figure out what’s happening. The consultant said “It just happens sometimes,” pretty much ADMITTING that their products are trash in quality. After that, he quoted me $850 to get it fixed. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS for an issue that I played no part in. He also said it is out of warranty so he can’t do anything about it. I was extremely frustrated so I called Apple customer service and they ALSO admitted that the product quality is on them BUT they want to milk me of my money. I asked to speak to someone else and got in contact with “product specialist” FRANCIS MARCEL who used the most CONDESCENDING tone I have ever heard being used on a loyal customer. He basically said to me to just be submissive and quiet and just fork up the $850 and that’s it. He ALSO acknowledged that it was Apple’s fault that my device was trash BUT still said yeah too bad it’s all on you and ur just unlucky. He said because your device is a gift from your dad from California, the responsibility for the device’s faults is not in Apple’s hands. I didn’t know that Apple’s customer service was so conditional, and that a product in USA and Australia are not under the same roof. Makes no sense. After putting me on hold for ages, he came back and said his manager agreed with what he had told me and then proceeded to HANG UP on me when I asked to speak with someone who could help me. This customer service is not even service it’s just finding ways to MILK ALL YOUR MONEY out of you. He talked about $850 like it was $0.85 and mocked me by explaining what a warranty is 300 times as if I did not know.DO NOT BUY FROM APPLE they trap you by making you pay for damages that they caused. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
"Awful.  This is the only way I can describe my experience with Apple...iPhone & customer service as well!  It has been a VERY long day of literally hours spent on the phone with their customer service....only to google & diagnose the issue on my daughters iPhone 7 myself & tell the THIRD tech service person what the issue is and where to find it described on APPLE's web site!  Mind you, when I said I just googled it & am reading it right here...their comment was ""Oh, where do you see that...I only have access to apple.com""...well, surprise...I'm on Apple.com where it tells me that the iPhone 7 has logic board issues and needs to be repaired (same as I told the last 2 reps I spoke with).  The poor girl on the other end of the phone was new with the company an seemed to have no experience at all with an iPhone...shame on Apple for not training her better...or even at all.  Now, I sit on hold yet, again for another 25 minutes to get this phone fixed that has not worked properly in 2 years.  So, now I'll wait for someone else to come on the phone to go through all their questions to come to the same conclusion to then wait for a box to be mailed to me so that I can mail the phone in...to wait..once again for it to be repaired & returned to me.  HOPEFULLY in full working order.  This was my only apple purchase and will surely be my last."
"My apple id has been disabled. I called Apple support and was on hold for 45 minutes, no answer. I reset my password. I am not allowed to update my payment. I need to speak to a human and not a robot.I also get put on hold when I try to schedule a genius bar appointment.I've been purchasing apple products for over ten years now, this is a joke. I think I'll just give up and go with Samsung, I need a new phone anyway."
"This has happened three times now. Everytime (EVERYTIME) that I Google from my phone about new phone deals, my speaker on my Iphone suddenly stops working so it's almost impossible to hear what people are saying. Apple, the cat is out of the bag and whatever software you have on your phone responsible for this needs to be taken off NOW"
"Apple has horrible service. I have been trying to make an appointment for a week to get my iPhone battery replaced.  There are never any appointments open online, the stores do not answer their phones and Apple support says I can only keep trying.  I can go to other stores but would prefer to take it directly to Apple, although if their repair is no better than their phone  service I guess that’s senseless also.  Apple needs to up their service and also make their products with batteries that can be easily changed by the consumer.  Terrible company to work with."
"Horrendous customer service I was on the phone for a hour then the girl who spoke very little English I’m assuming based in another country put the phone down"
"I absolutely love my new iphone se, it is quick, very user friendly and the battery-life is really good. Ordering at apple.com website was easy and the delivery was fast !!!"
"Ordered a lightning to 3.5 mm adapter from Apples online store received a few days later no issues whatsoever and was kept up to date throughout the orders process."
"40 minutes ‘chatting’ with a person who I thought had to be a bot due to canned responses and minutes of lag between each text.  All to get an appointment for someone to actually help!"
"My 7 Year old grandson managed to purchase 8 ‘free’ games without permission, It cost me $150- he can’t play with the games, but they refuse to give me a refund. I will never use this service again and will now buy another brand of computer and iPads. My pension is only $200 -per week, so I am very unhappy with the support I got from Apple."
"I'm so happy with my Air Pods, I can't live without them. Great quality and definitely worth the high price tag! I've been using them every day on my way to work. Fast delivery form apple website."
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Shocking considering the size and brand of this company. Called through to customer service to track a next day delivery item that had not arrived. Passed around pillar to post with no one able to tell me where or when it would be delivered. Was then asked to contact the courier directly to see if could get hold of them. Politely advised that I had ordered item from Apple and they are responsible for ensuring delivery."
"I contacted Apple Customer service in regards to my Apple credit card and the customer service person got rude about the question I was asking because I repeated my question so I would understand. Didn’t even bother asking if I needed any more help before the person ended the conversation. No people or customer service skills what’s so ever"
"Apple products and their service really deserve  minus.......Apple products and their service seems like a scam. They work fine until warranty expires and then boooom problems start kicking in ...SSD fails, logic board, issues with touch bar...If you bought apple care (on top of stupidly expensive machine) you could get all these taken care...but I am so annoyed by the quality of apple products and competency of people who make these products that a $3000 product does not even last for 2 years...I bought this macbook pro with touchbar and it did not even last more than 1.5 yrs, SSD or logic board died in the middle of a zoom meeting all of a sudden. On tops of that with newer macbooks you cannot fix/upgrade anything easily. For example, if SSD fails...good luck you need to replace entire logic board (as SSD and RAM are glued to the logic board)...Making a simple repair...more expensive.... A perfect scam for getting customers hooked to expensive repairs or replacement.This was my last apple product  ...surely not buying anything apple brand in future..."
"I'VE BEEN AN AVID APPLE SUPPORTER FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  iPHONES, iPADS AND A MAC.  ALWAYS WAS HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE AND SUPPORT.  EVER SICNE THEIR CRAP 13 UPDATE WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER AND I CALLED IN ON 10/7 I'VE SPENT OVER 60 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH OVER 25 ADVISORS PLUS ONE IDIOT ADVISOR HAD ME DRIVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY AND WASTE 3.5 HOURS AT THE GENIUS BAR THAT DID NOTHING.  LAST PDATE A WEEK AGO ANOTHER GLITCH.  CALLED IN AND ASKED AGAIN FOR SOME TYPE OF GOOD GESTURE FOR ALL THE CRAPY I'VE BEEN THROUGH.  ALL I WANTED WAS SOME LUSY EARBUDS.  AFTER 3 HOURS ON THE PHONE TONIGHT ONCE GETTING DISCONNECTED AND ANOTHER TWO HOUR CALL THE MANAGER TOLD THE ADVISOR NO.  SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING APPLE AND THEIR PRODUCTS ANY LONGER!  AS SOON AS THEIR STOCK GOES UP I'M SELLING IT AND I WILL TELL EVERYONE TO BUY A SAMSUNG!  APPLE HAS GONE COMPLETELY DONE THE TOILET!  SCREW THEM!  THEY MAKE ME SICK!!!!!!!"
"The problem was just a cracked screen. they sent me the shipping box and i shipped the phone via USPS. after 11 days, i called them and Luckily i got connected after waiting for 1 hours 48 minutes on phone line. But the creepy guy took my another one hour 27 minutes going back and forth just to say that they haven't received my phone and might have got lost.  He told me that you have to ship via FedEx. They also should instruct the customer how to ship and via which shipping company. People usually drop their shipping box to the nearest either Fedex, USPS, UPS or any other shipping companies."
"Apple / DHL were meant to deliver products for business ordered from the Apple Store via an express service.At the start all looked good. At 08:08 I was sent a text in the morning advising me of the delivery time between 11:41 - 13:41Delivery time came and went, no delivery. At 2pm a text was received advising the delivery was delayed, but it would be with me today.6pm I get a notification advising me my delivery was completed at 12:00 and supposedly signed for by me.How could this parcel have been delivered at 12? The parcel was not delivered, I suspect some else is now the happy owner of some nice Apple products.Really surprised to see Apple using such a second rate courier service. Poor show Apple and DHL."
"I had the worst experience ever visiting Apple Brent Cross on Saturday to buy EarPods. I was told to stand on the spots (not one foot outside the marked social distancing spots, which I had apparently done) when queuing to get into the store. I looked at the Apple employee who told me to get back on my spot and asked if he was serious? I hadn’t stepped any closer to the person in front of me or behind me, I had just moved to the side a little. I ignored this annoying incident and continued to queue distracting myself with my phone. Not paying much attention I soon got to the front of the queue and the next incident rattled me further. Without request, explanation or even curtesy another employee pointed a temperature at my forehead!!! It was the oddest sensation looking up and suddenly having a gun pointed at your head!! I must have looked shocked as he only then explained what he was doing. I told him he should ask first. My temperature was fine. He then gave me a mask, for which I declined. He told me it wasn’t optional and that I had to wear it to enter the store!!! Well what excessive rules Apple have imposed and Military style marshalling of their customers... the people who pay their wages!!!! Well over the top. Unfriendly, authoritarian staff, felt like I was in WW2 at checkpoint Charlie. Not going back to that store ever again. The experience left me feeling very uncomfortable and uneasy."
"Apple has provided me with the worst phones and experiences I have ever had in my life. The phone break easily, communication is poor, they will make you jump through hours of hoops before telling you that they can't help you. If there is an issue on their end they will do everything in their power to push the blame onto you. Your phone wont stop glitching because of a well known manufacturing issue on their side? Well they cant help you because you bought the phone used. They have wasted three weeks of my time. My recommendation would be buy any phone not made by apple. Don't support companies that make money off of making crappy products. I will never use apple again and I hope you don't either."
"I have 5 kids all going to private school, who say I must use an apple product. I have also used apple since my university days. Over the years I have seen an absolute decline in quality and service! I’m over the captive audience apple has. I am sick and tired of the crap service and inferior product apple provide. I NEVER thought I’d see the day that I’d say I’d never buy another apple product. I’m saying it NOW!! Apple can kiss my ASS!!! I and my kids have iPhones, iPads, laptops and iMacs, which we USED to replace every 2 years. Apple your service SUCKS!!! I’ve spent absolute Thousands on your crap Chinese Shi# products, and your crap service. NEVER EVER WILL I BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT. I’m so so pissed off with Apple.Improve your customer procedure manual!!!, which would improve your  CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Vanessa Sibson"
"My Apple Watch 5 stopped working after 6 months. Each time I turn on the cellular it turns off after a couple of minutes. I sent the watch in for repair 3 times and got it back with the same defect. A couple of weeks ago they moved the fault a level higher but up to now the only response was that I should update to the latest OS and to send them some logfiles.  This goes now on for more than 3 months. I will never again buy any Apple product."
"I just bought apple MacBook Air, and I am shocked that Apple removed all important necessaries to make it look nice, plus they are playing a dirty trick to upsell. it's ok if you are removing USB port then put alternative (adaptor) with it. well now surprise you bought a laptop and to check external source pay extra 25 bucks. wow. I have been using mac from 2013 and I am very disappointed with this new purchase and will definitely returning it. The fan just keeps running on a normal task. old mac air was way nicer. had two ports of usb+ car reader and best they had magnetic charger which was awesome. in my point of view, Apple has degraded their product. hope with this arm chip they will bring something good. I am mean why somebody will pay extra to check their USB. not many external hard drives and USBs come with type c still, I guess its a stupid move. the whole point of buying a laptop instead of iPad is you don't have to carry extra stuff with you all the time."
"I went to the Apple Store in Boise Town Square Mall. There are men there in black shirts, big men that are intimidating, hired bouncers if you will, who block you when you try to enter. They take your temperature without asking first! I believe this is my choice whether or not someone takes my temperature. Total invasion of privacy! Just ask..."
"I spent 3800 USD on my iMac and it's full of bugs and flaws. It looks great! Not 3800 USD great."
"God help you if you have a problem with your order, no one helps. They say they will email you yet no contact and issue still not resolved after 2 weeks!"
"Been living within the apple ecosystem for many years now (since the iphone 4). Still love the iPhone although it has its downfalls but the computers seem to have gone seriously downhill. Don't waste your money on their overpriced rubbish. My business partner relies on using his phone for emails as the mail on his iMac just crashes his computer. Same story here Ive ended up completely removing emails from my computer and rely on checking my emails on separate devices. My computer also regularly runs out of memory even when using the laptop essentially for just surfing the web, granted there may be 10 tabs open on chrome but for over £2000 I expect to be able to do that no problem at all. Once this thing dies I will be moving back to windows as I no longer see a benefit with Apple computers, they are just as vulnerable to virus' these days too so I cant justify the price tag for essentially a fancy piece of aluminium."
"Do not use Phobio for the apple trade in. I sent my MacBook Pro in perfect shape to them, a few days later I get told that the value is 0 because the computer is not turning on. I don't even care about the trade in value. What I am so upset about is that I am going to get a defective devise after me never having an issue with that computer. I hate them for it. and their response was "" boo hoo too bad for you"""
"My initial interaction when purchasing a new MacBook Air was somewhat unpleasant, I entered the Apple store in the Trafford Center looking for a new laptop for university. I am not well versed in the different features of Apple technology and was seeking some guidance to best accommodate my needs. I asked a gentleman the difference between a the MacBook Pro and air and he was very condescending stating that the name is obviously the difference. I quickly moved away from this rude man saying I’ll have to think about it, when In reality I was trying to find a different advisor. A couple of months after my purchase I noticed that my keyboard was faulty. I took it back to the Trafford branch and explained my predicament. The colleague took apart the keyboard but couldn’t put it back correctly and agreed it was in need of repair. He then went on to tell me that he would have to keep it for a minimum of 10 days. Due to the nature in which I use the laptop this was just not possible. I asked if there was anyway I could have a courtesy laptop to carry on my work but I was rudely rebuffed. So I returned home with my laptop in worse shape than before, I did however gain a verbal agreement that I could bring it back when I didn’t have such a heavy workload. A few months later, upon making an appointment to get my MacBook fixed I was told that I would be charged a large amount regardless of our previous agreement. Fast forward to my recent interaction. I reached out to another Apple support colleague the customer service I received was just fine and after an hour or so going back and forth she agreed that my MacBook should be fixed as it was faulty and not damaged due to my own actions. She then arranged for packaging to be sent to my house followed by a collection Service in 3-5 working days. However, this has not materialised nor has it been collected. I feel very let down by Apple as I’ve been trying sort this out for over a year now and trying to use a Broken MacBook is making my life increasingly difficult. Having invested a considerable amount of money into a product I thought would be substantial and a company that I thought was trustworthy I don’t feel this is acceptable. Sadly I will not be recommending Apple to anyone due to my experience."
"I had $17 and some cent come out of my account from Apple billing and I can’t get ahold of anyone at Apple to see what the charge is."
"Unfortunately I have to agree the support is unacceptable. A faulty product was not looked at properly, which I accept could happen, but due to only chat or call there is no way to do written communication so you have evidence to refer back to. Apple even ‘lied’ with a senior advisor promising to investigate the case personally and call me back before returning the product. They did not do this, so another hour on the phone (5 in total!!) and was told ‘that person must be off sick’, which is either another lie, or exposes a very poorly run team where cases are assigned to individuals with no back up process for holidays or sickness. A surprisingly awful experience, now heading to court."
"Disgusting company I ordered a £3500 Mac computer this week I never received it when I called Apple spent a day on the phone sorting things out and they have come to the conclusion that it was delivered and so they will not send a replacement or send me a refund be very careful spending your money with Apple online you are not protected it’s disgusting"
"DO NOT, NOT NOT  BUY APPLE’S iPad £100 COVER IF YOU VALUE  YOUR IPAD.  It offers no side protection for your iPad and if you accidentally drop your tablet it will almost certainly dent your case or at worst crack the screen,  and a cracked screen is not covered under warranty.  Apple will not want to know it, and from my experience will be rude, nasty and uncaring, even for a £1200 iPad less than 6 months old.   The cost of repair - in excess of £600"
"Kindergarden support. Useless"
"Apple is the worst company ever. They don’t stand behind any of the over priced devices. I’ve contacted them several times and they don’t care about none of their consumers. I will never purchase another Apple product. Hate I ever purchased the IPhone pro max and apple watches. The worst company ever."
"I bought an iPad with a faulty volume button and now I can’t get it replaced without shipping it out. I bought the iPad brand new in February and in April, the volume button just stops working, and it’s still under warranty.  The supervisor, Briar, at Apple told me I could do the express replacement, then when I called today about it they said their Apple policy didn’t allow it. So I was lied to. Not only was I sold a lemon, but then was lied to about the replacement and now I’m stuck with this faulty device until the US opens up again. Do not trust Apple! They are lying thieves. Looks like I need to start supporting Android. Thanks for your time and beware of Apple!"

"My phone battery is swollen - I booked an appointment at an Apple store, and they told me it’s nothing I have done (I do not overcharge or leave it in the sun etc) and it’s their fault, but I have to pay to get a new battery. I agreed to pay, and they said they’re closing so can’t actually do it, but book another appointment. At this point they also said my phone is very dangerous and not to use it! I use my phone for work so need to use it - how can they just tell me my phone is dangerous but come back another day! I went online to book another appointment and cannot get anything booked due to Apple just reopening after lockdown... No wonder these criminals have just lost a law suit in the USA regarding their batteries - how can they get away with being so awful!"
"Apple bricked my phone for security reasons.  All good except they won't let me unbrick it with my accounts and passwords.  I smashed the phone to pieces and I think it was the best decision of my life.  Today I start removing all apple devices from my home and work!  All PC and Android going forward."
"I owned almost all Apple devices. Problem emerged, they could not care less. PC has moved on quite a bit since the early years. I left and now have a PC and Android phone. Much more flexibility and because I broke from their ""brand"" I am not locked into one operating system or way of doing things anymore. Nor do I need to deal with them. They have good products but the service is utterly poor. Disrespecting you as a customer in fact. I ended up taking a case against them with Amex to win. I recommend if you have trouble with them, raise a section 75 against them. More people that do this, the more it'll impact them. And leave. There's loads of choice these days."
"6 hours on the phone and over a month in between for a software issue on their side that apple still has not been able to resolve. The only way you can get an update is by calling their main number (30-45 min on hold) or scheduling an appt by email. They can’t call you with an update unless you schedule an appointment and they can’t give you any info via email.  You can’t escalate (“my manager doesn’t talk to anyone externally”) and there is no consequence to them of taking weeks/months to resolve issues and making it as painful as possible to get in touch with them.  We have 21 apple products across my household. Switching to Android."
"Apple managed to let my iPhone get hacked x2 but when it does auto update when I have NOT ok’d that and crashes my phone and destroys my passwords they hang up after an hr wait, have no clue how to help, and make you wait 4 days while on call w/o a phone. Very dangerous group here. I had to spend 7 hrs total waiting on the phone to be told that. Then it crashes my iPad also just like the phone. I got a new credit card and iCloud refuses to let it be put in.I have tried the last two weeks. They tell me to start over then won’t accept my email address as someone else has it. Yes that would be me when they crashed the phone.   It’s an impossible group to deal with. Got an android burner while waiting out this mess. They have been very good to work with."
"Apple is so rich that they do not care about their customers. My wife,s  Iphone is not working due to salt water damage. I purchased appleCare extended warranty when I bought the phone. Now Apple promised to ship another replacement phone via FedEX. Bases on tracking FedEX number, the package supposed to be delivered yesterday June 19th by 8pm. Today is June 20th and I still have not received the package. I called Fedex and I was told they don,t know when it will be delivered. I called Apple customer service and the guy told me that I have to wait at least one week before calling Apple back. I told him that this delivery suppose to be 2 day express shipping and he said that I have to wait. Apple is holding about $1400.00 on my credit card until I return the original phone. Now I can not receive the new phone and I can not use my credit card to buy another phone like Galaxy because apple is holding my money on my credit card. Apple is so rich and arrogant that they can do anything to a customer and nobody can do do anything to them. Too bad."
"I’m big fan of Apple and using Apple product  since 2007. Apple needs to consider a new budget  iPhone with notch cut display."
"Apple Netherlands is by far the most The most disgusting customer service I have ever experience. Every single senior advisor is so rude! They give you the lowest level of customer service, I had 1 of them interrupt me speaking every sentence and when I said ""I would appreciate if you let me finish my sentence"" HE HUNG UP THE PHONE. incredible. My phone was purchased straight from the Apple store in Den Haag with damage with the charging port not working correctly. I've sent it out for repairs and it keeps coming back broken and they write that they are fixing other problems like the camera which I never complained about. I asked about my replacement rights because the problem Isn’t being solved. And they tell me they don’t have that option for me. 1300€ down the drain. I will NEVER buy anything from Apple ever again."
"these airpod pros SUCK!!! such a disappointment to pay so much for such crap hardware. its frustrating and annoying to constantly only have one earpod connect and have to keep putting them back in the case over and over again to get both to connect. also the right one loses power way quicker than the left. Sound is good, but who cares when getting constantly having to jump through hoops to get them to work right. OVERALL THESE ARE CRAP AND I WILL NEVER BUY AIRPODS AGAIN. Hopefully the beats headphones i ordered to replace these arent crap like"
"Apple, do better!Purchased a new iPhone, after 3 days the battery is not holding charge and the quality of sound on speaker phone is poor.Ordered my phone On the 6th June, arrived on the 8th June, rang Apple on 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th June to highlight the problem  - no resolution to the issue - can’t get a refund or a new phone! Staff are unhelpful and often rude - Hector!"
"Awful. Plain awfulI have ordered one IMac which arrived - it was laggy slow and took hours to open anything let alone turn on! NOT what you want during covid 19 times! I assumed it was faulty - and after speaking to apple support - who knew no more than my 11yr old son (not a joke - my son asked something and he said he didn’t know what he meant!) After arranging for it to be collected a new one was sent out. The new one was just as bad. The old one still hasn’t been collected about a 2weeks later. Still not collected. We have phoned 10times. Arranged for collection 4. Never been collectedI don’t know whether I just keep it?Come on APPLE! What’s the hype about? An awful brand? Yep!Please hit helpful if this helps!"
"Genuinely appalling service and shocking for such a reputable company. I will never buy from Apple again following the customer service I have received this past week with regards to a faulty device. Disgraceful communication and efficiency."
"If I could leave no stars I would. The WORST customer service I have ever experienced! Such incapable staff and poor customer care. Common issue with my model of phone and this has not been resolved after 9 days of a malfunctioning device, a 3 hour trip to bluewater and 11 hours on the phone. Never leave a review but feel so shocked and appalled by the way I have been spoken to and the cost and inconvenience I am expected to to take on just to get my device fixed."
"Purchase a New iPad 7th Generation, Received it by UPS.  Completely Smashed and dented.  Call them and they wanted me to use AppleCare to get a replacement.  Shipped it back to them the same day I received it.  Told I would get my refund  3 to 5 days,   called again three more times each time I would get my refund in  3 to 5 days.   it has been almost 1 month and still no refund  spoke to them today and relayed 3 to 5 days,     Asked to speak to supervisor  and I was  told it would be 30 minute and we cannot tie up the phone line.  I was waiting for 45 minutes to speak  to  someone who would tell me 3 to 5 days.     I would warn everyone about Apple  customer service it S--K"
"Apple Support denied the replacement of my old iPod nano 1st generation. Initially, the product has been recalled due to a battery overheating and burning hazard. However, in 2020 Apple denied my request to replace it even though the older the battery becomes the more likely will it overheat or burn. All in all I am very disappointed."

"I am an Apple (Macintosh) customer since 1989 and this year I got for the first time really frustrated with a brand I loved.Bought a very expensive laptop and an iPhone 11, the latter arrived next day but wasn’t working, spent hours on the phone to get a box that I had to package with the phone and post it back (and we are trying to limit our movement due to Coronavirus) at the post office, when would have been much easier to send someone to collect the phone on the actual box since the phone come day one with malfunction... anyhow, a week later, still no news, spent two hours on the phone with a very cortese chap, but still no news. The laptop, coming from Shangai (not sure why we cannot have some ready to order in UK, anyhow) two weeks waiting to (suppository) get the computer via UPS (a real joke! Cannot believe a company like Apple can allow suck a farse of company to take care of their shipments) I finally get an email, your computer will be delivered tomorrow 9am-1pm, all good, waited patiently home for the parcel to arrive, nothing... check the status on the App, now changed to, by the end of the day... the end of the day arrive, still no computer. In the morning a strange message “A mechanical failure has delay the shipping, we are adjusting our planning and bla bla will let you know” called apple, two hours on the phone, my computer still in Dubai, Brocken plain bit sure when will arrive... two hours later I receive an email from UPS, your parcel will be with you Friday 9am-1pm, two hours later, a new email, your parcel will be delivered Tuesday 9am-1pm... I am now waiting to see what going to happen, but so far we are a week behind schedule and I am not an happy customer at all! Not sure I will buy again an iPhone, let see the rest."

I can’t log into my Apple ID because I need to receive a message code at my old phone number, which btw I never gave them when making this account: privacy invasion #1, which also happens to get this: NOT EXIST ANYMORE. Seriously how the FUC*. It’s honestly kind of funny to be honest. How ret4rded can a system be. Buy android goddamn"
"Dear Apple , I have been using your products since 2015. I’ve used my MacBook Air frequently especially, via quarantine. Suddenly, mine stopped working, I sent it in for repair because all the stores are closed and was informed the  issue was the back light. 💡 I sent in my computer for repair and the estimate was  $950.00! When I called to check on the status for the repair,  one of your representatives, (Chad),  was very unprofessional and condescending and literally Loll, at my situation really?My consent for repair was immediately rescinded! I am now the happy owner of a Lovely, Lenovo product.  Apple #dobetter"
"Bought an Apple Watch one month ago and it froze twice and got stuck on the Apple logo. I tried all the recommended fixes and later contacted Apple Support who after some trouble shooting suggestions which failed arranged for me to send watch via their courier. I gave my watch to the courier UPS and 6 days later it still hasn’t arrived back to Apple. I’ve been tracking progress on line and nothing has moved! This is so infuriating and I am so disappointed after spending a huge amount of money on a watch and to be met with such shoddy service. I have many Apple products but my faith in Apple after this has been diminished. They need to get a much better courier than UPS and improve their customer support."
"Please don't buy machines from Apple. I bought an Macbook pro, 2018. Buying this one of the worst decisions I ever made. The system died within 7 months of buying it. The system doesn't charge. It is dead. I bought the machine because I was tired of getting my previous Dell laptop repaired. I bought it because I thought, surely Apple would be hassle free. It is not. And what's more it has taken all my data with it. At least with Dell, I never lost my data.The repair people are also completely clueless. When my laptop stopped charging. I asked F1 Info repair people what to do. I told them what the problem was. They asked me to bring the machine in. I asked them about my data, they said it would be fine. Then they wasted the remaining battery on trying to ""figure things out"". After the battery drained away, they cheerfully told me, they couldn't do anything about the data as the hard disk is welded onto the motherboard and since there was no power, the data was lost. This piece of information would have been really helpful, before they asked me bring in my machine. I could have backed up the most important things. I have no choice now. I am stuck with piece of garbage. But this is the last Apple product I will ever buy. Apple is all propaganda. Maybe sometime long, long back the brand meant reliability but now they are just cashing in their reputation. People who want reliability are better off looking for it elsewhere.And for all the status seekers, this is a piece of junk machine. Find a better status symbol than a brand who is conning you."
"Greedy company that only cares about money money money"
"Apple sucks they just bought the beats headphones mine still had manufactured warranty it took me an 1 hour to get everything situated with the customer service rep I explained to her what exactly was wrong with my headphones and she said I’m sending you another pair send us yours so I send them mine and I never received any from them so I call them come to find out the warranty didn’t cover my headphones but the email they sent me they wanted me to purchase the same warranty I had so it didn’t cover while I had it but if I buy the same warranty it will cover don’t make sense and then they wanted me to buy another pair at a discounted price the beats headphones suck that would’ve been my 3rd pair and I never used the ones I was sending them to replace smh it’s all about money with apple and there liars and there warranty is a damn scam smh they don’t warranty nothing and they bought out a cheap headphones brand so I recommend for no one to buy beats based on my experience they suck and there part of apple now"
"Tried to cancell ""electronically"" small charge shows up still on bill still next month or soSpeak to Apple CSR go round and round with Apple id ""we do not see you in the system"" have to call my credit card company to dispute it,unbelievable to me the only way to kill their recurring bills is to go that route.Used to ne a Apple fanboyThis is not what you expect from the richest company in the world  .. .  Or is it?????"
"Yesterday I had to engage with apple ID services for the first time. This was one of the most dreadful experience I ever had with a company in the telecom industry.My iPhone was broken but fortunately insured with EE. To be able to complete the claim process I was told that I will need to deactivate or delete the phone from my Apple Id account, which I did. Somehow the EE agent could not see any change on their screen which showed the phone was still active. There was nothing else I could do through the apple website since the device was no longer listed there. The phone was broke therefore I could re-list the device on my apple id account to try again. The EE agent suggested that I contact apple as they were the only one who could deactivate the device. I called apple, got through their 4 minutes automated process before been put on hold for half an hour, when I finally managed to speak to an agent, the agent did not listen what I was saying, did not seems to believe that we deleted the phone from the account and insisted that I must have another Apple ID account, (which we do not). Finally, as the agent was unable to resolve the situation, I was told to hold while they were consulting with their supervisor. About half an hour later the music stop and a message saying that my call was in the queue started playing every minute. I waited a further 15 minutes and the phone call want down. I called EE to make sure that the phone was still active and to check that I had the correct MEI number, EE confirmed that the phone was still showing as active and that they could not process the claim as if they did while the phone was still active I may be invoiced by Apple for the replacement of the phone. I called Apple again and the same scenario repeated Itself, 4 minuted to talk to a robot before been put on hold for half an hour then 10 minutes conversation with a human, on hold for another 45 minutes and the call was disconnected. I call apple straight back and after waiting for another half an hour I was speaking to an agent again. This time to avoid been disconnected and treated with complacency, I informed the agent that I was recording the call, then explained the situation. after listening carefully the agent started to ask few questions before demanding for the conversation not to be recorded, I asked him to wait for a second, I stopped the recording pointing out, that since I informed him that the conversation was recorded I intended to keep the recording up to that point. He then asked me to delete the recorded conversation, as I refused to do so, he then ended the call without further discussion. It is now 08.00 pm I made the first phone call to EE at 2:45. After wasting 5 hours and 15 minutes I am getting nowhere, I will have no option but to try again tomorrow.This beg the following questions:1) why the phone still showed as active after been deleted not working and switched off.2) Why after having to hold half an hour to speak to someone on two occasions I was put on hold die a further 45 minutes until the call was disconnected.3) What does Apple has to hide about a  conversation with a loyal customer related to a seemingly small technical issue, to go to the extent of refusing to deal with the customer who wants to record what has been said?4) Why a customer should be threatened to have to pay the cost of a phone replacement following a genuine insurance claim, simply because he is unable to disconnect the phone through the platform Apple is providing for this purpose?5) Why an Apple and a EE Business customer should be deprived of a claim and the use of a device properly insured for days because of an Apple ID glitch?This is how Apple treats customers having an iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple notebook, Apple TV and Iplayer...  If  Steve Job was still alive Apple will surely not be treating customers this way. Android provider must be delighted that Apple is becoming such a poor competitor."
"Apple service is sucks it’s impossible to talk to them I try to fix something and they shut for something they charge me"
"30 minutes of holding to find no help from a rude young girl. It’s ridiculous considering how much money we pay for Apple stuff!!!"
"Worthless Apple ServiceI wanted to return two products to Apple.  I filled out the forms online and then it said ""click here to print mailing label.""  I did and was not able to see the mailing label let alone print it.  I made several calls to Apple Singapore and was met with people who could not understand basic English.  They passed me from one to another and I had to start over each time.  Finally the courier calls me for pickup.  I tell him I don't have the labels.  He says you don't need the labels, just write the return number on the package.  Why the hell didn't the fools on the customer service line tell me that?  Several hours wasted."
"I like my keyboard that My husband purchased for me. I give one star only because when i pick up my stuff the service is terrible ever."
"Apple, when someone disables their phone and cant use it. dont make it that when we wanna use our apple ID that we need our phone number to fix it. i now have to wait not the 4 days your employee said but a full week.  make it that we can use either our phone number or email. i would have had my phone fixed a lot faster."
"Screw you Apple . Your phones are not bad but you azzlose  are messing with our phones so we can buy new one as soon as we pay it off. I’m buying flip flop prepaid phone . Screw you mfosIf I can give you finger for rating instead of 1 star I would"
"I had an Apple 8 Plus after 1 year started problems with the audio. Anytime you used the speaker your conversation had a crackling audio sound. I did replace it with Sprint because they would only send me a refurbished phone. So I decided to go with Apple since they would give me a new phone. However, Little did I know I was going to have the same problem with my new iphone. It seems Apples 8 plus phones have the same issue. Having my mom at home in hospice I did not need any extra stress or headaches. Called Apple and they told me they would send me a new phone, however, it was not in a new box. It was a box just for the phone. I called apple and they advise me that this was a new replacement. The phone still had the same problem. Called Apple again (keep in mind it was my 3rd phone now in 2 months and the phone did not accept my sim card. Apple could not send me a new sim card because my provider was Sprint. Well, I had to go to 5 Sprint stores in order to get the sim card. Now that I had my new phone working I immediately mailed back the old one so I could get a refund. They tell you that they only take your credit card as a security, however, my credit card got charged. So within 2 months, I was charged $1000. Now let see how long it takes for Apple to give me back my money. That same day I mailed back my phone, my new phone started having problems with the upgrade and my new phone stopped working that night. So now, I have no phone. Called Apple again and tried to be patient. However, I spent 3 hrs on the computer with my new phone updating the software and guess what, my phone died completely; Now I have no phone. Apple called the Boca Raton store and they got me an appointment for 5:30 pm. So I asked Apple if they had a new Iphone 8 Plus and the Senior Advisor told me that they would not tell them of inventory. So here I am dealing with apple who is just wasting my time again, they had me do upgrades on the software, making me run around like a chicken without a head to find out that they did not know if the Boca Store had any new iphones 8 plus in stock. So I decided to call Apple again and have them send me a new phone but they wanted a credit card to hold a charge of $500 again and worse part is that they were not mailing me a new phone. They were mailing me a refurbished/certified phone. I did not paid for an used phone, I paid for a new phone. So if you are all reading this review, please be advised that Apple sends out refurbish phones. So is not worse buying from Apple anymore. Their products do not stand by their names. I will never buy an Apple phone, Mac laptop, or table to say the least because they all work the same way. I am a very disastified client and I do not recommend Apple to anyone anymore. What a horrible way of doing business with them. Their policy only benefits them, not their clients."
"I have been using IPhones and IPads for as long as I can remember. On 9/19/18, my husband and I purchased 2 Apple watches through Sprint(my second). I have been wearing my watch almost all of the time since then with no issue. On 6/12/20, I woke up and realized my watch was dead. Upon taking it off to charge, I found a round burn on my wrist from the bottom of the watch. I called Apple support on 6/15/20 to report the issue, just hoping for a replacement watch. I submitted photos to the representative and while on the phone with the rep, Tonya, I attempted to put the watch back on for the first time since I found the burn; she had said they may want a photo of it on to see how I wear it. I put it on and almost immediately received a shock from the device. The rep heard me yelp and advised me to NOT put it back on. She sent the information to another division and advised she would call me back in a few hours. Upon calling me back, she told me that they had determined that they would not be replacing the device and that I should follow up with my physician as I may be allergic to the watch materials(that I've not had an issue with since purchasing.) I am extremely disappointed with the way that Apple has handled this, especially because their product has caused me physical harm. I'm considering getting rid of all of our Apple products at this point."
"They lost my repair phone in the mail and never refunded me the money. They charged me 432.00 on my Wells Fargo account. I got charged a fee for overdraft going below $0. Apple never refunded me and I had to report fraud and wait for 4 weeks to be able to get my money back from Wells Fargo, Apple continued to say “we never received the phone” that they lost. Will never buy an Apple phone again. Do NOT PAY FOR APPLE CARE."
"I will not be purchasing Apple products any longer due to their poor customer service/relations. I was essentially accused of being a liar about my problem and also told repeatedly that “I just don’t get it” as if I am an idiot. The rep didn’t seem overly brilliant himself which was surprising that he was in any position of making decisions for any company. The phone call ended with the rep just hanging up the phone and I was not in the mood to call back to be on hold again for thirty minutes. Anyway, it’s amazing that my $69 AirPod problem was worth Apple losing thousands of dollars of my computer, iPad, and phone business? Great job Apple, great job."
"Went with a problem to Lakeside Apple store where my wife's brand iPhone had a problem where the other person could not hear her clearly. Even with an appointment we were made to wait at the ""genius"" bar. After about 1/2 hour the ""genius"" told us that they had run some diagnostics on the hardware and found no problem so it must be the network. They did wipe the phone off all the data too. My wife changed the network but the problem persisted and made another appointment, another hour wait, factory reset, lost data then was told again network problem. When we told we had changed network he asked her how she holds the phone and proceeded to say she is holding it wrong! The problem persists till today, only upside is I don't have to talk to my wife on the phone when I don't want to."
"Sadly I must say this is the less serious and less honest company I have ever found in all my life. Period.I own and owned a lot of Mac computers and phones. I spent a lot of my money to enrich this company, like many many others.After 2 years all their products start having huge problems (main boards, monitor flickering, batteries...) for which you have to spend more than the actual value.In the meantime you need another machine, so you spend again and again, you loose your time to make tests, backups, formatting, and to call the stupid and 100% useless assistance...In all this, the very smart Apple do a triple business: 1) When you purchase a new product; 2) When you break it - inevitably after 2 years. No stories! - and you try to repair it (cost to repair it equal the actual value); 3) And when you, in the meantime, have to purchase another one or you have to stop working...A fraud? This is more than a fraud. It is called planned obsolescence and Apple is the number one in this field!They recognise their own defects after a lot of claims (see customer associations) but, mostly of the time, they accept to repair just a few part of the defected computers.They are absolutely not a serious company as they perfectly know if a computer model they released is working or not.But they don't care about it, and you. They need money. A lot of money. If you purchase a Mac it's now just YOUR problem."
"Apple ""technicians"" are doing a really POOR REPAIR PERFORMANCES""I received my iPhone 11 PRO from ""APPLE"" repair center with the rubber that joint the screen with the iPhone body destroyed.Really unbelievable. Repair ID: D459154112I'm really disappointed and now I know that I CAN NOT trust apple anymore."
"You have taken payment for my iPhone battery to be replace but I’ve now waited 5 days for it to be collected.You should only take payments when the service is complete.I don’t want any excuses even with this pandemic your service should be much better.I have no landline iPad battery starting to run lower.This is not good enough I’m also working from home and have been since April.If my iPad battery runs out I’d be very reluctant to pay for another one.Your telephone customer service staff are terrible.If DPD aren’t here by Monday when my iPhone is actually given back to me with a new battery I will make a complaint,Don’t blame DPD it’s your appalling service.You need new telephone support staff who listen,aren’t just reading from a script,people who understand and empathise with the customer."
"My mac book broke to my dismay I thought ""Ew no way am i going to apple they always over charge"" however After taking it to a local repair shop the man said I can charge you 500 pounds or either you can try apple. So I did, even during corona I thought why not I spoke on the phone to an advisor (Named albert, who had a lovely accent) he told me my mac was covered by apple care and I would be getting it fixed no charge. Literally within 2 days of sending out my mac book to DHL, who also did a banging job (to my suprise) in picking up and delivery my mac book was sent back with all my data and all the parts replaced, perfectly APPLE you have won and impressed. Could not have asked for better service MANY THANKS <3"
"I'm surprised that there are so many negative comments about customer service. I've been purchasing Apple and Windows products for 15 years and Apple have always treated me well. I had a Sony Vaio that was constantly plagued with problems (wifi, keyboard, screen, battery, trackpad) and would spend 8 weeks at a time being serviced by Sony (thats how long it took them to repair any issue I had). Since these issues didnt all arise at once I would send it in for repair and wait 2 months to get it back only to have used it for a few days until a new issue would pop up and the cycle repeated. I ended up shoving the laptop at the back of my closet in frustration and Sony would go on to cease making laptops altogether. My next purchase was a 13 inch Macbook Pro in 2017 that served me well over the years with no issues until recently. One was the problematic keyboard that many complained about (thankfully the new 2020 models don't have this issue any more). The second problem I had was with the screen. In an act of rage i slammed the lid on my Macbook with great force because of some bad news I received and the screen went completely black and would'nt turn on. My Macbook was just out of warranty and I was worried it would cost me a fortune to fix. I took it in to the Apple store in Chatswood for repair and they replaced my keyboard for free and they replaced my screen and didn't charge me for the parts (which is not cheap and can cost anywhere between $400-$1200 for a new screen). Apple only charged me $149 for the service fee. Since my warranty was void Apple could have charged me for every piece i needed repaired if they wanted to. However, they were kind enough to supply the parts free and only charge me the service fee. This goes to show that Apple does really care about customer satisfaction. Thank You Apple!"
"APPLE AirPod Pro AIRPOD AIR POD PRO HEADPHONESApologies for the crass review above. I have not found a way to review that AirPod pros and how horribly they are.  The dictation is abhorrent, it takes 30 seconds for the AirPod pros to even register that you were talking.  The dictation quality is so important that it is impossible to even form a sentence.  I cannot even make out the basic commands and it is better for me to talk directly to the iPhone than to use the AirPods  to talk or dictate. Please respond to me, 786-479-9789. Also, the Apple care is horrendous regards to this product. Good luck everyone do not buy them. For listening quality, it is OK."
"My iPhone freezes once everyday less then 2 years old, MAC blocks all sites I try to open, just had support online about these issues went through 2 people neither could help then they set up a phone call, phone rang on hold for 20 mins and then it just hung up, created a case number clicked on case number it asked for last name came back last name does not match the case #MAC is running like a PC on Dial Up right now, guess it is better to have someone outside apple help and pay them to fix this if they can.Every time they do an update new problems arise, won't update to Catalina with all the bad reviews that system is getting and I cannot afford to lose any data when you switch. they need help"
"The help support its rubish i boght so many things frome iphone and one time i have a problem with one of the phons an the can’t help what a shame"
"I hate apple support!!! I have tried for almost a year to reset my passcode on my Apple ID. I can verify everything but the old card I have on file. They put me into account recovery and never let me into the account. I can verify billing address, send an image of my ID, etc. I’m sick and tired of being told I need to wait and never hear back. It would be different if I wasn’t using the same phone the ID is on, same number, same passcode to unlock the phone, etc. I’m done with apple next upgrade I will move to Samsung!"
"I've never played a game on my phone before in my life. Last year I found a game called Pixel Fighter and I loved it! The game was really enjoyable and fun and I ended up spending thousands of dollars on it. While the game itself was fun the customer support and developers for the game were a nightmare to deal with. I had multiple issues from mischarges to not receiving in-game currency I paid for. I got sick of getting nowhere with them so I called apple. I talked to someone from customer support and told them my situation they calmly told me how to go ahead getting a refund from my bank. I asked the supervisor before hanging up this isn't going to get me blocked from my game I have thousands of dollars into the game and hundreds of hours played. The supervisor assured me that the developer has been paid and the refund will come from Apple. So I listen to what he says and I go ahead and do it. So, of course, two weeks after doing it I get blocked from the game. The people from Apple were willing to do nothing to help all they did was offer me rental credits 😂. Their advice gets me blocked I lose out on thousands of dollars and offer me rental credits. I've been an Apple supporter my whole life but this is plain wrong."
"Have everything Apple do does my kids and husband they are amazing worth every penny and last for ever."
"I am at my wits end with Apple's crappy products and terrible customer service. Where do I even start.1. iPhone XS, bought 1 year ago and still under warranty, started doing a weird ghost touch thing about 2 weeks ago that makes in unusable.I take for repair, they say its not covered by warranty because there is a tiny crack in the CAMERA UNIT. I'd really love to understand how a tiny crack in the camera unit is affecting the screen of this 1000€ phone that it would make it not covered by warranty.2. MacBook Pro 13 bought in 2018, the real pain of my life. I'd like to remind you it's a product I've paid nearly 3000€ for.Within 6 months it needed a screen replacement, battery replacement (twice) and keyboard replacement. Now 1,5 years later the battery is still not working as it's supposed to – it literally went from 88% to 40% in 30 minutes as I'm typing this, oh look 39% now! – and, after hearing a weird crackling sound for about 2 weeks, I found out that the keyboard is not working properly once again – part of it too sticky to type properly, while some of they keys have completely come off (the crackling sound was coming from the glue melting)!The best part? I took it for repair and the shop assistant told me it can't be replaced / fix under warranty, in spite of this being a renown issue and Apple having rolled out a keyboard replacement program, BECAUSE THE KEYS ARE OFF THE PRODUCT IS CLASSIFIED AS BROKEN and therefore not covered by warranty. ALTHOUGH THE PRODUCT IS BROKEN BECAUSE OF ITS OWN DEFECT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!Not to mention the screen, which is all stained and should also be replaced because of their stain gate program, but I haven't even tried to exercise my rights with that issue.My partner also has a MacBook Pro 15 that needed a screen replacement, and they gave it back with WiFi and bluetooth / Airdrop broken 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻So we currently own over 7000 € - SEVEN THOUSAND EUROS - worth of Apple products and not even one of them is working properly.Every time I contact support they try to run some diagnostics and keep me on the phone / in the chat for ever without actively trying to help me but passing my case between people, to make matters worse I'm also abroad and all of their national helpline numbers are only available if you're calling from the country itself.I depend 100% on my devices to run my business and this is turning into my worst, most expensive and most time consuming nightmare.I'm quickly going from being a die-hard Apple fan to hating the brand with all of my soul."
"If I could give apple support 0 stars I would because that’s what they deserve.  The customer service is horrible.  It’s impossible to get an appointment and once you receive a confirmation that you do have one only to get there and the store is closed.  They ask you to understand and be patient due to Covid but they are not extending that same courtesy.  My phone has been broken over a month.  Now I’ve been on hold over 1hour but they keep saying it will only be 5-7 minute wait time.  I’m so over apple I’m going back to Android.  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Elisha Mason"
"Leave it to the ""experts"" not to know how the system works. when a person doesn't know that the Roland TR-808 is supposed to have 808's !!!!!and tells me I'm supposed to download them, there's a problem. Specialist of what? she tells me ""she's a producer and from Atlanta, but never heard of the Roland TR-808"" and my mind just got blown. PATHETIC!!!!!!!!! ya'll get your billion dollar company up and maybe throw in some extra bucks on real ""specialist"" smh P.O.S. company."
"Apple using DPD for delivery, absolutely rubbish, I waited for two days and driver did not turn up, contacted Apple, Apple staff just do not care, extremely disappointed. I spend so much money to buy a product and received this type of service, will never buy products from Apple again."
"The phone/machine as always is superior in quality and experience, BUT, I HATE how they try to control everything/everyone... Just bought an iPhone Xr because my last one, iPhone 6S, wasn’t big enough anymore for my social media needs (work). So I’m trying to figure out how to set up my TOUCH ID, and guess what? YOU CAN’T... Apple only lets you do FACE ID!!! Well, they are not going to get me to put my face in their database.. and because of that now I have to type in a 6 digit number for everything I need and I have to retype my password for all my apps each time I use them... APPLE YOU SUCK!"
"Apples quality is good however if i am paying £1000 for an iPhone its mine i can do whatever i want with it i paid for it so whatever i do with it has nothing to do with you so why cant i jailbreak my phone even if it damages the phone that has nothing to do with you i paid you the money so let me do whatever i wish with the phone, this is why samsung is better at these stuff than apple"
"Another staingate victim refused any type of help or assistance from Apple. Classic"
"macbook pro charging port loose and not working properly after 2 years, iphone xs max charging port not working after 1 year, and icloud storage is a totally fraudulent scam that even their senior support staff dont understand! awful!"
"Absolutely stunning service from Apple over the past few months...My iPad Mini 5 had a fault in warranty - I spoke to them and they arranged a same-day drop off at a local store. The next day I got an email saying it arrived at Apple at about 2pm - by 5pm they had diagnosed the fault and shipped a new unit. It arrived the next morning. At every stage, I was communicated with perfectly and this level of service came from buying their cheapest iPad product (ie. was not exclusively reserved for people who bought he Pro units at 5 times the price)My wife needed a new iPhone - we ordered at about 4.20pm, and again with great communication and using the best courier in the UK right now (DPD) it arrived on a 1 hour time slot delivery the next day."

"Beware of Apple's trade in program. My experience was they estimated my trade-in value of my Macbook Pro at $760 then only gave me $260 and I wasted hours on support calls to get it adjusted to no avail. I'm not buying their justification for the $500 ding. I've been a loyal Apple fan since the mid-90s, but the quality of the Macbook Pro was the worst I've ever experienced from an Apple product - which is why I had to buy a new laptop in the first place when that one was falling apart after less than 3 years - and now this insult to injury. Not cool, Apple."
"I did download an app (sticker maker) in October last year, I deleted it right away the same day as it said it was a free trial and then they will charge me with a subscription, so I just deleted it. Today, 8 months later I realized that they have been charging to my credit card 9.99 usd every week since October.... 309 usd later apple said I’m not eligible for a refund as the charges were too old. This is not fair and it shouldn’t be legal just to charge people for something they are not even using ! Very disappointed of apple’s customer service."
"Do NOT BUY BEATS EPI bought some Beats EP headphones. When i bought them i thought they seemed a bit flimsy. around 7 months later HEADPHONES CANT PLAY ANY AUDIO? the primary function for headphones is simply playing audio... beats are suppose to be well made etc and they cant even last. My headphones still look brand new! zero damage to wires etc. I spoke to customer service and they was cocky af! sending me links to incorrect pages. I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW! DO NO BUY BEATS HEADPHONES! Prior to me getting these headphones I had some Sony headphones for around 3 years and they worked a treat! Dont waste your money as overpriced crap."
"awful customer service.... brand new phone and already having issues with it ...my iPhone not even 2 month and having some problem with it ... phone calls cut both way ...Battery wont last .. customer service full of lies and excuses... I just had enough and wont recommend apple at all..."

"11 years' user Apple, first device is an iPod touch 2nd gen, then an iPad 2, beautiful experience. Used Android phones for a few years and was disappointed to and smashed them all, bloody stupid Samsung and HTC! When I got my first iPhone, an iPhone 6, I finally have a reliable phone. Sooner I switched all my devices to Apple, this made my life a lot easier. No ecosystems can compare with Apple's."
"Worse customer service of my life!! Defective iPhone per their own post & after keeping it 4 weeks they returned it NOT REPAIRED & refuse to do so!! I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT!!  BUYER BEWARE!"
"This is the worst i sent Apple my phone to get repaired and I still haven’t gotten it back it’s been two weeks. At least with Samsung they were a lot faster than Apple"
"Horrible customer service!Asked for the manager to talk to, they said Manager will call me back and never heard from them! I’ve been a customer for a very long time and placed 5 orders this year alone but extremely disappointed with their customer service when I needed help they were not there. Will start exploring different brands, where people care for people not just to make a sale! 1 star is too much!"
"Apple is just money hungry. Tim Cook is scam artist and he should go die in a hole. Giving a phone a new camera isn’t a update. He purposely degrades the phone with every update and forces us to buy new ones, I hope he reads this and kills himself honestly, he takes advantage of everyone and is one greedy. Karma will get you."
"Worst customer service experience ever. All I'm asking them to replace my brand new purchased powerbeats as I'm having issues since the day one of purchase. I only used it for two weeks. They completely understood it and agreed with there is an issue but still, instead of giving me a new pair they want to service it. I've been using Apple products for last 10 years now and I'm highly disappointed about this scenario. Also, I have to wait for 3 weeks to get it returned service item back. How come a multi-billion-dollar company can't replace an item instantly. Worth thinking twice before purchasing any apple products."
"Even one star too much for apple!!!!!! Bad experience with my iphone 11pro just bought few months ago, garantie still running, the surprise is : how can fix my device????????? I should travel to Dubai from Lebanon to fix it !!!!!!!! Really bad service. I can’t recommend anybody to buy 11pro since 1st day i bought i have i prob with camera and never geotagging. What a bug!!!!!!"
"I am shocked by the number of bad ratings about Apple so would like to add my own opinion and hopefully help to level things out.I have owned a MacBook Pro for some years now and when I purchased it I took out AppleCare. It ran out many years ago but when I call Apple for help the service is second to none. I am not very technologically inclined but they always help me if I get stuck by taking over my screen (with no access to my content I hasten to say) and very soon set me back on the right path. If the service person hasn’t enough knowledge for my particular problem they refer it to a specialist and I have never, in about seven years, been let down. They are never in a hurry and will spend as much time as is needed to resolve any problems. This service is why I would never purchase anything but Apple and can absolutely recommend the products, especially for  people like me (I am 82) who do need a bit of help with technology.I still have my MacBook Pro but my IPad is a dinosaur so I decided to upgrade to an 11” 2020 I Pad Pro. I really like the photo editing software on my MacBook Pro and had checked the editing on I Pads over the past couple of years and found it to be lacking and so delayed upgrading my I Pad.Now that I have taken the plunge I am glad I waited because the new 2020  IPad Pro has brilliant photo editing software and once I get used to it I think it will be even better than the MacBook Pro editing software. When on holiday (If we ever get any of those again) it means that I can do everything I need on my new IPad  I will not need to take a laptop. I have also lashed out on the Magic Keyboard and am loving it. It is easier to take around the house than my MacBook Pro because the combined weight of the IPad and the keyboard is far lighter than the MacBook Pro.It is excellent for emails etc but my other hobby is writing and I think I will probably stay with Pages on my MacBook Pro for that because it is less sensitive when typing. But then again, I might be finding it sensitive because I am not yet ‘acclimatised’ to the Magic Keyboard size. It really is a great piece of equipment though.So my five stars are for Apple service, the new 2020 11” IPad Pro and also the Magic Keyboard. Well done Apple, you are the Rolls Royce of computer technology."
"They literally don’t know how to help you with anything. Apple used to have prime costumer support now is all downhill I am very disappointed with it. Makes me not want to buy any more Apple products. THUMBS DOWN!!"
"Worst systems i have ever seen..didn't realise how bad it was until i lost my phone somewhere around my house and couldn't find it anywhere, thought great il just use find my iphone but oh wait it needs to be downloaded on an iphone or ipad...kinda an issue when you'll be surprised to know i only own one iphone thats LOST, then it said go on icloud.com or something but kept saying my password is wrong when its not, tried resetting it and guess what you need your iphone to reset it 🤣🤣🤣then it said its locked my account for 3 days to reset pass or some BS which is good how when you've LOST your phone?and get this, it asks for your credit card details legit all of them to reset your password? luckily i found it myself but jesus if i didn't idfk how i would find it..also got offered £30 for a pristine condition iphone SE 1st gen when even they sell them + all shops sell them for minimum £140 complete scam."
"Recently traded in an iPhone 6 which I’ve had from new, very good condition, offered £45 trade in by Apple against a new phone. After receiving the phone, Apple reduced trade in to £0 and charged my credit card the £45. I would not have bought from them if I had known that was going to happen. This is scandalous, one very annoyed and disappointed customer who won’t be using Apple trade in again. Buyers beware, avoid using this company direct"
"Apple worth billions and can't provide a battery in a crisis. What on earth are they? Seems to me they're worth nothing."
"I wish I could put negative 300 stars. I got the Mac Mini 2018 version because I thought I could upgrade the RAM by myself because apple fu ckta rds charge their exorbitant prices for easy basic stuff you can do with no issues on a PC. I got the RAM and installed it. Upgrading the RAM on a mac is a long process. After having it put back together, the display doesn't work and won't be detected by my monitor. Ready to toss the $1,500 crap in the trash where it belongs. Screw apple."
"I ordered the new Macbook Air 2020. The computer arrived faulty, the Caps Lock wouldnt work, you had to press the Caps Lock very slowly and gently for it to turn on and if you tapped it too hard, or tapped it on the right hand side of the button, it wouldnt turn on. I called them and they sent me a replacement - same problemI called them again, they sent me a 3rd replacement - same problem again.They appear to give you a quality product, but actually its a total load of cheap crap. I wouldnt say that about the iphone though, I have an iphone 8+ and i love it, no issues whatsoever, the Macbook Air 2020 - cheap, overpriced and unreliable - back to Windows I go."
"So disappointed, left me and the team high and dry during our COVID-19 response, no flexibility, no response, no way to complain... nothing. Going to switch to Dell..."
"Apple is a greedy awful company.  I am a school speech therapist giving special needs children teletherapy.  I tried to engage the child with bubbles (he was super engaged) until I spilled bubble solution on my 9 month old personal Apple Mac Book Air.  The screen started flickering, took it to a service center, was quoted 835$ repair fee and would only guarantee it for 90 days.  I spoke to a manager at customer service and said there was NOTHING they could do for me.  Really? A company making millions off this pandemic couldn’t help wave this fee to a speech therapist trying to reach children with Autism.   The greed is disgusting."
"Dear all,I am writing this review by my own after getting frustrated by service of apple, I got the problem in my iPhone in Lockdown due to Covid-19, and my warranty expired on 5th may I visited apple store on 12-13 May, they told me to email apple, I twitted apple and I got a call from Apple support, they have done my appointment of Saturday i.e 30th may @3PM. When I visited the apple service partner they told me we are not working after 1 Pm.I am like football, going to the courts only.As I mentioned in starting that my phone is not in warranty and I got a problem in my device in lockdown bcz of Quarantine I am unable to call u, before warranty expired, Now tell me Can you guys help me to get repair my phone with no repairing cost, or what. They kept me hold on call for 2 hr. And the funny thing you know, when your warranty gets expired then only your phone will start giving you the problems"
"The way the ""advisors"" treat you on the phone is insulting. They take no responsibility when a hardware defect causes your 6 month old iPhone 11 pro to become a paperweight. They encouraged me to factory reset the device even though the iPhone told me it would become inoperable after I did that. They blame you and insist that you will have to pay for the repair. This is no longer a company I believe in and will move all my devices OUT of their ecosystem."
"Great products, especially software!"
"I purchased a ipad mini 4, 18 months ago from Argos. During lock down  i Face timed my daughter, then left it on table untill the evening when i went to use it again it was  completely dead. would not charge. i contacted a company near me . apple repair company. they have justed opened this week. They looked at it and said it was battery, they ordered new battery, but still would not work. now told us it is the mother board and can not be repaired. Not happy as this should have had a longer live that, 18 months. as it is not a cheap item it was over £400 pounds. i have had other tables over the years that have lasted years, then sold them on."
"Their products are terrible their customer service is just as = their products if not worse every time I call them they are completely rude, act like I'm stupid this is why move to Samsung when I was 15 and I'm never going back to Apple"
"I had a issue with my iPhone saying there was a software problem, after unsuccessfully trying to sort it myself, I message customer service and they phoned straight back and talked me through how to solve the problem, was very helpful"
"Whoever is in charge of apple now-a-days has absolutely lost my support in this company... IT'S 2020... HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE AN IMAC WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE... (and dont even start with the ""touch bar"" because it is crap...) Not only that, your itunes has turned to complete trash... Once my iphone dies (cause im broke) I will more than likely switch to android cause apple has made so many stupid, user-unfriendly changes, that i do not want to spend hundreds, even thousands, of dollars on this crap product. screw you apple."
"Wife talked me into converting to Apple 10 yrs ago and slowly I adopted their ecosystem over that decade.  Covid-19 required me to get a Dell Windows laptop to connect efficiently & productively to my work Remote Desktop (the same that 99.9% of the financial services industry uses) and I forgot how easy, intuitively and seamlessly Windows operates.  I chucked the MacBook Pro I initially intended to keep for personal use and next will acquire a Samsung phone.  I’ll be free of Apple’s smugness and lack of open source connectivity outside of their ecosystem in 30 days.  FREEDOM!  I still love my wife, but no love loss for Apple after a decade of trying it out."
"I update my Mac Air as instructed and I couldn't log in after that tho my password is correct. It was fine just before update and when I went over to their service centre , was told I have to pay to rectify the problem which is indeed not fair . Why should I pay for Apple update malfunction ?? No wonder Apple is losing all their customers to China made products ."
"Apple has become TRASHI used to be an Apple FANATIC. As a late Apple adopter my first device with the pin wheel MP3 player.  I believed you get what you pay for that the premium price tag meant I would experience exceptional service.  THAT USED TO BE THE CASE.I was less than enthusiastic about the continuing iOS updates and how that gradually made rather good handsets obsolete.  Still as I started using more and more of the iPhone capabilities it became a part of every part of life from shopping to cooking and even exercise in some way Apple got incorporated into everything.  Then came my iPad Air which I was given as a sign-up gift for a household utility.  I was now fully an Apple user until 3 weeks ago when my iPad Pro was last updated and everything went sideways.  My device was wrecked as I could not do anything on it reliably.  It would crash looking like it was a hands free hard reset but not responding like a hard reset and starting up in 5-15 seconds opening in the standard ways.  I was given the run around about doing factory reset, delete and reload the affected apps then having to reinstall the update but for that the PRO needed help from a computer (yes, I know it’s supposed to be a stand alone portable device).  What followed was a comedy of errors, device would not backup, couldn’t get the update to fully reinstall, had a host of random errors but most of it was hampered by the fact that the device kept on restarting itself in after a few moments.  The device became more erratic after “fixing” it was escalated and engineers advised that yes the hardware could very well have been affected by the software update but it would still be an out of warranty service in other words “we messed up but you get to pay for the fix”.What angered me the most of my experience was the way they kept looking for a way to blame me, flat out lying to me, the being passed around like a hot potato and the refusal to accept that their software damaged a perfectly good iPad which I have every right to expect them to repair. Yet all I got is “we sorry but you know it’s not covered by warranty” to which I responded that I didn’t break it your software update broke it. I then said I wanted to refer it to my local consumer disputes tribunal and would need to know whom to name as a representative.  So NO they won’t give me the a name or title. They won’t tell me what the process says just this is their decision event though the software caused me loss and damage they maintain the position that they have no responsibility to provide remedy.  In the end they violated my consumer rights and left me with the full understanding of the low standing they view people. Anyone who buys Apple can look forward to paying premium for the privilege of being treated in a manner that would leave you feeling like a class A idiot for believing their Hype.I now have an inconvenient paper weight. I was due to upgrade my phone now that they finally at long last have a product that would have suited my needs.  I will not be buying Apple if there is anyway to avoid it and there certainly are many ways to avoid Apple products.  When the 10 Apple devices ranging from iPads to MP3 players need upgrades I will be sourcing something where I get what I expect or where I can replace the device without substantial financial loss."
"I can’t believe you guys refused to refund me after my son secretly bought some items in Minecraft marketplace without our Permission. Its over $200, which is a lot of money to us, especially during this time. I’m very unhappy with your service."
"I have been discriminated against for not speaking English, I have problems with a purchase of a laptop and my Apple Cash and for not knowing how to speak English they did not refer me to the financial department, they told me to study it and that when I learned I would call again!  terrible!  no to bullying"
"My experience with Apple has been the worst ever. I bought my item online and should be next day delivery. 7days after and counting it's still not with me. They blame the courier (DPD) service for losing it. Both of them have been washing their hand and sending me back and forth while blaming each other's faults. In the end, I still do not have my item and Apple could not even refund me until the investigation on where the item is complete. Apple is the most bureacratic company I have ever seen. I am not surprised why many people hate them. I am sadly one of them now. Their customer service (except for one) is very rude. I will never purchase an Apple item again."
"Apple is happy to take your money but refuse to help when things go wrong.I was encouraged to send my Beats Headphones in for repair as it was under warranty after explaining the damage to the representative. Apple returned my headphones and did not bother to let me know that they were doing so. The headphones were sent back with zero care knocking around in a cardboard box, and now are damaged beyond recognition. Not only have Apple not repaired them as promised, not contacted me to keep me abreast, but they have incurred much worse damage to my headphones. Senior advisors can do nothing to help. I'll spend my money where I am valued as a customer next time. Live and learn."
"A £700 washer dryer has broken down 6 times in 2 years and they won't replace it. The last engineer appointmented by Samsung (ACL - look them up if you think Samsung are bad) turned up with half the parts, then FLOODED my house and said he had nothing to clear it up. He then forgot to cut water off and it flooded again! Samsung wont accept liability for damage so I'm having to take them to court. I have literally 30 emails with minimal replies and the support is literally the worst I have come across. To the point that even though I love my Samsung phone, I will never buy another Samsung device just in case there are issues. They won't honour the 5 year warranty as I can't find a confirmation even though I have screenshot of the offer.I have been promised callbacks on roughly 15 occasions and think I have had 2 actually call, resolve absolutely nothing and promise another call back. Guess what... No reply."
"Well i like some Samsung products, but I think i am done with them for good after this experience. Short version... dishwasher leaked 3 times (entire floor wet including rugs) and they just want to keep sending out techs. Refusing to replace as tech wrote each time that they see no defect. And Home Depot is no better... plus i paid for the additional protection, waste of money. Even got my file escalated at Samsung and when i missed their call it was impossible to get connected to them and stuck spending time on hold while someone tries to sort it out. Terrible customer service, terrible product, and wasted hours of my time between phone and repair people, etc.  For a so called great dishwasher this is a joke... by LG or other, and go to Lowe's or other."
"I recently purchased a Samsung TV. I had to contact customer services regarding a problem with the TV. The customer service adviser I spoke to with the problem said that I needed to register the product and said he would pass me through to carry this out, after being left on hold and repeated announcement that my call was important, after 20 minutes I abandoned the call. My TV problem was not resolved, should I buy another TV, Samsung would not be my choice. Alan Gauntlett"
"The Oscar for “Worst Customer Support” should definitely go to SAMSUNG. What an awful experience with their delivery and customer service. Avoid if possible."
"Wow, how foolish I am for ever thinking highly of Samsung. I used to look up to Samsung quite highly, but after my last encounter, I won't be back.I just got done with their chat support, perhaps that was my issue? However, I purchased a TV from them that was supposed to be delivered today. It didn't come, no problem, but the tracking number, just showed an error.So I decided to contact them. I was told that shipping stopped responding as of Monday 12/16/2020 and that if they don't update the information within 7 days of that, the order will be refunded and I can place it again.What? First of all, you mean to tell me that the shipper has stopped responding, and I need to sit and wait a week before you'll get off your rear end and see what's going on or begin to work on some kind of solution? Worse yet you aren't going to replace the item, you're going to refund the order, then make me place a new one. Which means waiting until the refund clears, then placing a new order, waiting for that to ship, etc. Just more senseless waiting.I was then told that if I hadn't received the TV by the 23rd, to contact them again. I politely declined their $15 time sensitive credit, and wished them a good day. I ended the chat after that and stating that if I had to wait for to the 23rd for anyone to do anything I would just cancel the order and go elsewhere.Upon ending the chat I marked the solution as not solved and begun writing my optional comment explaining the terrible experience. After the first sentence the windows mysteriously closed. We all know chat representatives can see what you type while connected to them, perhaps they can see that now too.After having it force closed, I came here to make sure they couldn't delete what just happened. Samsung is about making money. They could care less about making relationships and being loyal to their customers. Save your cash and stop buying their overpriced products.I'll end this with, I sincerely hope the TV never comes. That it isn't late, but stolen or lost. If this is the service I can expect for tracking a shipment, what on earth will happen when it needs repaired, or comes defective? I don't want to find out. I have no cancel button or I would cancel the order, and tonight, I am not in the mood to talk with another agent, I probably won't be friendly and there is nothing good to come of that.Take mind and the advice of the thousands of others who reviewed Samsung. Stay away."
"good products. I will buy more"
"I owned Samsung phones as far back as I can remember. I had a note 9 and kept seeing ads on my phone for the new Note 20 Ultra. So I gave in and purchased the N20Ultra via the Shop app on my Samsung Note 9. Stupid me, as I was finalizing my purchase that promised a discount up to 50% off the N20U there, an option pops up for a guarantee 50% buy back if you trade the N20U at a future date. I read nothing that it was an either or option regarding 50% off now or stupid 50% guaranteed trade in value later!!! So you have to be careful about those last second offers when you're checking out!!! Dumb me, believing Samsung was giving such a great deal. Not knowing what I had done and still expecting 50% off waited for my trade in to be processed to get the discount. I spoke to one CSR and she informed me that my trade in was valued at $499 (honestly don't remember the exact amount but $500 keeps coming to mind) BUT I was only given a trade amount of $250. I tried to no avail to have Samsung give me what I purchased. I will no longer go to Samsung directly to purchase. It's been a lot better experience with Best Buy or Sprint - now TMobile. I might even try another make because these phones are  ridiculously priced! Oh, the process to ""inspect"" my trade in took so long before I was notified of it's completion that I passed the grace period to fix the issue of the purchase, thirty days from time I ordered the phone. Shame Samusung! Your Shop app framed the purchase and checkout in such a way that I didn't get what I thought I was purchasing; a pre-order purchase price of the Note 20 Ultra"
"Dealing with Samsung has been the worst experience of my life. We purchased a Q700T 55 inch television for nearly £1900. As an added bonus was a free Z flip phone. On the free phone application it CLEARLY offered the customer the option of either a purple or a black mobile so we indicated that we preferred a black coloured phone yet they forwarded a purple phone instead!We protested by calling the Samsung promotional team on 03330164052. We had a written confirmation that Samsung commited an error and they would organise a returns label. When the returns label failed to turn up nearly THREE weeks later we contacted the promotional team once again. After much protracted arguments we received an email to say that they would not be exchanging the phone. We were flabbergasted!!! Despite us forwarding the email confirming the exchange they failed to budge an inch!!! After much protests I was promised a retun call from their head of customer service within two hours. Guess what? A day later I am still waiting for that promised call. Take my word for it - steer clear of Samsung because they treat customers with disdain!UPDATEThings just get from bad to worse with regards to my issue of colour choice of a free flip phone that came with my purchaseof a tv. After the long drawn battle I evantually got a call froma 'so called' supervisor named Vivan. Guess what? Samsung customer care is rotten right from the top!!!  Vivan stubbornly refused to accept a written email confirming my choice of colour meaning that are not bound by any written statement. Furthermore, Vivan stated that she would confirm all her contact details in an email. That email never materialised. Leaves a very bad taste in the mouth for Samsung"
"Quick postage, great device.Really pleased with everything and I got a great deal :)"
"Always used you guys for tvs! really happy and last for years"
"Extremely disappointed with the level of service and customer care from Samsung. I ordered a TV on the 25th November and it was excited for delivery on the 27th. Unfortunately that is where the excitement ends, the TV was delivered smashed and the return process has been nothing short of a nightmare. The courier pickup date was changed without my consultation and pushed back a working week which now has impacted the 7-10 working days that it takes for the Samsung team to assess the TV and then send replacement. It's been two weeks of support tickets and calls and I still have no idea whether a replacement will be delivered by the 18th December when I am moving house or whether they can deliver to the new address?"
"excellent phones and monitors. I am using samsung for years now and I love it!!"
"Just received the samsung s20 and yet another company trying to capitalise on pointless acceries and yes I'm talking about not having a headphone jack port. May just be me but very disappointed 😞"
"Don't purchase from this untrustworthy company.This company is good to take your hard working money but not good enough to sort out any bad situations after buying     samsung company don't stick to the company agreements. Think twice before purchasing it really ain't worth the heartache or headache."
"I love Samsung products specially phones , they are durable , great camera specs and efficient ram . I have been using this phone for the past 5 years . They never failed me They can easily connect with diff phones for transferring files . Long lasting battery life and phones are adaptable in diff charger which is convenient . Looking forward for more Samsung new model ."
"I bought a new Samsung cell phone from Samsung. I could have paid 40% less but wanted the security of buying from them. I am having a problem with it. I go on their website and an online assistant advised me to get it fixed. I scheduled an appointment for yesterday . In the morning I called to confirm the appointment, lines were busy so I left a message and with 20 minutes received a call confirming my appointment. This place was not close or convenient. It took me well over an hour to get there by Uber. I noticed a hand written note on the door "" closed for training"" I have to spend twice as much time and money to get my phone fixed now. I so regret becoming a Samsung customer. Their idea of warranty service is making a handicapped person run around all day. I have called a number of times and been told everything from mail your phone to we will have someone pick it up and drop it off. Disgraceful systems"
"Samsung Website/Community/Tech Support  Very dysfunctional.  Could not sign up to join the community, the process appears not to work.  Their tech support is a joke.Also, the latest update to Samsung Notes is terrible.  I want to reverse it but I don't know how."
"I have CRG9. So I guess I got the bad one. Screen tearing, Gsync not working, and also few dead pixels spots. I waited for all this long and this is what I get."
"Of Course samsung is a very nice and clever company it made a lot of electronics like Phones , Tablets , iPad , Tv , Laptops and Watches and most people of the world use their products and the whole world know about their product and their income is billions so samsung is a huge company"
"sh*itty slow service, they force to do 2 step verification and they set a timer for code expiration but the funny part that you don't even receive the code, if you are lucky you receive it way after the timer they set have expired, frustrating slow and s*hit service"
"After calling numerous times I'm told the code to redeem my $200 credit is valid. Well obviously not because it still doesn't work. No one has an answer for this."
"I bought a Samsung CLP-640ND laser printer. It seemed great at first, and worked nicely for about 15 months. I didn't use it a lot so I didn't replace the toner for 15 months or so. Again great for a while until I did a long run of about 80 copies ... towards the end the colours separated, like ghost images. Now it seems there is no solution to the problem and it is useless.What a waste of over £200!"
"I have been a Samsung user ever since. I love it. I'm happy with Samsung. Great job!"
"Bought a 55” 8k TV QE55Q700TATXXUI got a black screen of death 10 days later; technical support useless.Customer support from overseas (non uk) with terrible connection and poor language for dealing with a uk customer.Was informed that to replace tv they must receive the broken one first, meaning I would be 3/4 days with no tv.Decided I would just return the broken one and buy a new one from a competitor....man what a task that was; online bot too busy so no use, telephone support took me to 4 different departments.All in all a poor attempt at customer support."
"Been an avid fan of Samsung products for 3 years! It's only recent that my Samsung A30 has been experiencing lots of lags lately, plus the charging time has been slower than before. I am not sure whether the updates have been really helpful to speed up things on my phone. Hope to experience definite improvements on the next update."
"Inspiring designs and always up to date standards"
"I accidently cracked my Samsung smart watch and called to see if the watch face could be fixed and for what price. I was told to call the local YouBreakItWeFIXIT store.  Well, none of the local stores fix Samsung watch faces, despite that being on Samsung's site.  So I called Samsung back and asked them to give me their address to send my broken watch to and how much it would cost to fix it.  No one seemed to know, so the next day I call back TWO DIFFERENT agents, the first one didn't do anything but give me a ticket number and was told to call the main number. I asked her why she couldn't do it with just this one chat.  She said she wished she could, but that's not how it worked there.  I called the main number and they wanted the serial number which I gave them and they couldn't ""find"" it.  They once again told me to call the You Break It We Fix it place and I told her that I had already been there and done that and that this store does NOT repair cracked watch faces.  I was told they would call back as they were still looking up the serial number.  Finally service rep #2 said it would cost $140 to have it fixed at You Break It We Fix it.  She never did answer how to send the blessed watch to the manufacturer. It seemed to be a trick question on my part apparently.  Bottom line- I bought a new watch from Best Buy, bought the protection plan and sent my old watch to the bottom of the drawer.  Customer service at Samsung is NON-EXISTANT. Basically you break it, you buy a new one!"
"Absolutely bloody abysmal.  Ordered an S20+ on two separate occasions, the orders were accepted and delivery slots offered.  Then about 3 hours later the orders were cancelled for no valid reason.  I am still waiting for their finance department to contact me.Their products are great but their customer service is non existent.  Save yourself grief and buy from Apple."
"We purchased a Samsung oven range 2 months ago which was a double oven with their “flex duo” technology. We had only used the single oven up until the Thanksgiving Holiday, when we used both ovens for the first time, This is when we discovered that the double oven is not a true double oven as advertised. Imagine our frustration when we went to cook a second dish as our turkey was roasting, only to discover that we couldn’t cook the dish because the two ovens have to be within 100 degrees of each other to use them at the same time. I have read the product description of the oven we purchased up and down, and NOWHERE does it state these limitations with the oven. It states that you can “cook two dishes at two different temperatures” implying this to be the case regardless of the temperature range - which is not true. As a marketing professional, I find this to be false and misleading. We did a LOT of research and comparing various appliances before we purchased all new appliances for our home, and we would definitely not have purchased this particular oven had we known this information. We cook often, and we need the flexibility to be able to cook in two ovens and whatever temperatures the food calls for - that is what a double oven is. At this point, we are outside the store’s return policy (Only two weeks), and after chatting with Samsung online, I was told I need to go back to the store in which we purchased. Samsung is responsible for writing the product descriptions of their products, so it should be up to the. To replace or refund their product which was sold under false pretenses. I hope to hear back from Samsung with a resolution to this before I have to involve an attorney and the BBB. I would highly recommend NOT purchasing an oven of theirs with the Flex Duo technology if you are looking for an actual double oven."
"Liers and thiefs !!!!I got 82"" tv a year ago after 2 month the tv stop work and samsong told me its not repairable, so 2 month after they come pick up the tv and say i will get a refund check by mail Its 8 month after i didnt get my koney back yet and the cradit card company say its more than 3 minth after so they cand do a chargeback on it Ticket number 415-250-4773"
"SAMSUNG has given me the WORST customer service I have ever received in my entire life! I pre ordered a Note 20 ultra and received a $200 promotional credit to use on their samsung store. A MONTH MONTH AGO I tried purchasing a TAB A using my credit. I got an error code... promo code was no longer usable after that and I never was able to finish my order. I have called so many times I've lost count! I've tried using the chat option. I've been tossed around from department to department. I've been told by so many people that the problem was resolved and to "" wait a few days to receive a new promo code"" I've now spoken to a supervisor who acted so shocked  at my call history that they record when you call. She assured me this is such a rare case and she can't believe I've had to go through this. AND STILL I HAVEN'T BEEN HELPED!!!! Who exactly can I talk to!? I want to scream!!! And no one will listen. I've been so nice to each and every customer service agent who I've been transferred too until today when I broke down crying because I'm sick and tired of telling my story over and over and over. If samsung reads this. Go ahead and look up my ticket number. Want to see how bad your customer service is? #3794482."
"I needed my washing machine repaired.  I filled out a repair ticket online but I got a text with a message saying that they had no people in my area to send, so they canceled.  I called Samsung and the person on the phone told me he had called the company and I would have my visit the next day at 3:30.  Nobody came, called back, they said, they were sorry but they had no records of my call and that they had not scheduled anyone.  Worst customer service.  Bad training.  The associate basically just wanted to get rid of me, and made me believe he had scheduled a service. If all calls are recorded, did somebody erased my call?"
"Awful customer service!They will try everything possible to not resolve any issue... will never buy a Samsung again plus will talk everyone I know out of buying one!"
"The rotating plate in my Samsung Smart oven broke across the middle whilst the oven was in operation. Oven delivered after Amazon purchase through suppliers Crompton and Wood; it arrived in May. Samsung customer services refused to replace the plate. The oven cost in excess of £300. I got told the warranty ran out at the end of October. Just unbelievable. I felt for the person on the other end of the chat. I remained calm and polite but just sometimes you wonder how these big companies exist. Just appalling."
"Such an awful experience with this company. I bought a Samsung television (Still not even 1 year ago) and less than 5 months later I was barely and not forcefully pushing it back against the wall because it is on a wall mount and the screen went black. The television was under warranty and is tell under warranty and they told me I would have to pay to have it replaced, essentially as much as I paid for the television. I spoke to customer service telling them that they needed to honor the warranty and fix it. I also told them cannot make expensive not durable pieces of equipment!! They lied to me 4 times, telling me they would call me back. NEVER DID! I had to call back and of course had to restart from zero. SOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!! Now I'm stuck with a TV that has minor blemish that even the technician said would be ""An easy fix. It wouldn't take me more that 20 minutes"", that is still under warranty. WORST COMPANY! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They don't honor their warranty. Never buying a Samsung product ever again."
"Worst customer service out there. The customer service must be based in some area not US bc the calls are very bad, can’t hear anything and they can’t solve any of my problems!! Do not buy from samsung if there is another option! Buy from their direct competitors bc the direct competitors have better customer service!"
"3 Month old Samsung A21   broke  sent via UK supply BT ( another joke)  had a basic non informative email saying ' They had cancelled the repair' NO Explanation,  phone their number for the repair shop, couldn't understand why it was sent, they were non helpful.Got intouch with BT who couldn't give me an up date, then I found out a new phone was being sent out but the 'repair' shop wanted it in to 'make sure' it was working according to BT. My suspicions  aroused I re contacted the repair shop, No its not a new phone you will receive but a A grade refurbished on'  Misrepresentation springs to mind. Avoid!! Avoid !! Avoid. !!"
"Very irate.Broken refund process. Followed Samsung mobile return process. I purchased off the website a galaxy 20 se & after receiving, I decided I couldn’t use it and wanted a note 20, I called the same dy of receipt explained. CSR gave a RMA and cell was mailed next day following the Samsung process. Samsung has received phone. I still have not been refunded so Verizon financing will stop all chrgs. Samsung keeps transferring me around and says the people responsible have no direct line. These actions causes upgrade ineligible, financing open & I have broken cell. I need a cell. I wouldn’t purchase from them. Go to your cell carrier. They are dishonest."
"I recently bought Samsung S20FE and exchanged a OnePlus 5T (A5010; in good condition) on the purchase page for 75 pounds. To my surprise I found the Samsung partner page where the actual recycle value is 100 pounds. I tried to resolve to with customer support both kept passing calls to each other (not to say with insincere sincere apologies).   I am moving to Apple ... Never in life Samsung again."
"(Belgium)One of our samsung phones failed (could not start-up any more), it was about 6 months old. We only had standard waranty.- On Sunday I entered the details on the samsung website. - Monday there was a pick up service at our door to collect the defect phone. - On Wednesday a delivery service brought back the repaired phone! Free of charge.What can one expect more :)"
"Overpriced, underspecc'd garbage. Buying a phone from samsung is the equivalent of paying 20 euros for a glass of mud. Literally, the Apple of Android devices. Stay away."
"If i could rate it at a zero i would. Absolutely worse customer service experience I've had. I've been hung up on they can not answer a single question beside saying sorry. I would not recommend ordering anything from Samsung direct."
"The worst service ever in my life i have seen is this my refrigerator was not working since 3june and that mother***ers are not at at solving after taking moneytropical service center surat samsung authorise service station"
"As many people have pointed out, Samsung Customer Service is awful.  How can they keep doing this to people?  Don't fall for their warranty promises.  You will be sent on a wild goose chase and they will steal your device.  Have an Active 2 watch that they had me send in and they totally misrepresented what I told them was wrong with a completely fabricated issue on their part because the rep didn't know what she was talking about.  Three weeks later, I get it back unrepaired.  Set it up again to fix what was wrong, sent it in, and they now say the repair has been cancelled and supposedly will be giving me an exchange.  However, no one can give me any information (probably 20 reps , so far) and they keep saying ""call back in 2 or 3 business days"".  Be aware of their tactics including having someone named ""Kayla"" from ""The Office of the President"" call and say she'll take care of it.  This is just another delay tactic.  How can a company just steal your property like that?  They will say they didn't steal it, but what do you call it when you send them your property in good faith and they keep it indefinitely without resolving the issue?  Meanwhile, I'm out of over $300.  What really worries me is that I have other Samsung products amounting to over $4K including a refrigerator.  I would advise anyone looking at Samsung products to run, don't walk, quickly to some other, ANY other brand.  Great products, in theory.  Absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  They should be shut down and BestBuy should be ashamed of helping them mislead people."
"November 14, 2020Bought the UN65KS9000 tv back in 2016Unless you have an extended warranty Do NOT BOTHER buying any Samsung TV or any of their products.Early on I have had light bleeding on the bottom of the screen.Before the warranty ran out, one year, the screen was replaced twice after numerous discussions with the Samsung hierarchy. Thepeople on the Samsung trouble line phone number are polite and want to solve problems but once if goes to the Samsung hierarchy they want to blame it on the consumer.After the warranty ran out the 2nd panel replacement had the same problem.After various phone calls and a letter to Samsung corporate to replace the tv rather than replace the panel they decided to replace the panel.About a year ago I started having the same problem.I had the same tv repair company with the same repair person look at the tv.It cost me $65 to come and look at the tv. The repair person told me that it would cost me $1400 to replace the panel. The repair estimate went to Samsung and I never heard back from them.I decided to live with the problemBut recently, after 4 years, I sent Samsung a corporate email about my problem for one last try. Someone from corporate called me to explain my problem.After explaining and mentioning that this problem was all over the internet for this particular model the representative told me that the tv was too old and that Nothing could be done.I told her to look online at all the complaints and to look at my past incidents. Again she told me again that nothing could be done!Because of my frustration with Samsung I decided to write this review."
"Very disgusting and unprofessional customer service. I am never thinking that Samsung brand will put my life and my family on the risk.On 22 October I place the order, the supply me faulty washer dryer, its took few days to start complain, 1 day for collection, and collection service even don't call when they arrive.Was begin Samsung provide me washer dryer, because of Covid-19 I need wash my clothes more often.Samsung say we have process 7-10 days for replacement, and I beg for replacement quicker, call 100 times......nothingAfter 10 days I recieved replacement 😪Was huge scratch on the front door, and again complain, my partner was literally crying.Samsung don't care, replacement will be 10 days.Every 2 days I spend 9 pound for public laundry. I send around 20 emailsI made 100 calls ask for manager and waiting hours and nothing.Spend more then 800 pounds and nothingI wash my sock in the sink.That its properly Samsung face, leave customer without nothing and keep my money.3 bloody years I am not smoking, but after hours calling and repeat order number name adrees.I was write them today asking for compensation, we will see what they reply and hopefully I will recieve my replacement after nearly month.P.S they disposal my old indesit washing machinePlease avoid purchase directly from SamsungIf someone know CEO Samsung email, can you please share with me."
"Bought a new gaming monitor. A short while after the warenty periode, it's now faulty with bad-lines all over the screen. Tryed to contact customer support, but no response of yet after several weeks. I can't recommend Samsung anymore."
"Tv now 8 days late.Not even shipped before had to be here..Now for the second time have to go and schedule delivery with shipping companyLee kun-hee would have burned down his us logistics facility"
"I was trying to recover data from an old phone with a broken screen. Data recovery options were limited so I was heavily relying on Samsung Cloud. I kept running into issues that shouldn't even be happening, and customer support was not very helpful.When reaching out to support, their first reflex will often be to concoct some explanation or excuse as to why your problem isn't really a problem. Even when I come armed with screenshots and proof, it takes a lot of convincing before they accept that the problem is real, and again even more to convince them to commit to fixing it. They'll often try to convince me that something must be wrong on my end — slow internet, not enough memory, or they'll pretend that what I am experiencing is expected and normal. I've had Support people ask me to check back in a couple days to see if the problem goes away on its own. Seriously?What really upset me was when Support recommended me to purchase an adapter cable for my phone, which I later realized would not actually work. I did not realize what was wrong until after I had already purchased the cable and realized I couldn't even use it. This caused me to waste not only time but also my own money, not counting time already spent talking with Support. The Support team had mislead me and sent me on a wild goose-chase. When I tried to reach out to them again, I was passed around to a couple more reps and then they just hung up on me.I always maintained a respectful tone with them, even when I was boiling with anger on the inside. So to be treated like this was shocking.I used to give them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they were trying their best to help and just lacked the expertise. But now I see that they just give you the run around and try to wear you down.The Samsung Cloud issue was never resolved, I ended going to a third-party repair shop to manually recover my data instead.I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because despite the issues with their online services, their phone is an otherwise great product."
"Thanks for selling good products. It is one of the trusted mobile company in india. Great services."
"I use Galaxy S20 5G. This is just a fantastic phone. I chose this particular model after researching the camera options and finding this was the best performing even among the S20-series. 5/5 would recommend!"
"If I could give zero, I would. Terrible customer service, terrible repairment! I bought a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra a week ago, It came as faulty from factory. I was receiving error messages and I couldn't access play store, internet etc. So, I sent it to their repair centre but I received the phone back as ""DAMAGED!!"" They damaged my camera, It has cracs on the camera lens and fingerprints on the innerside. It was a brand new phone, I didn't even use it before I sent it to them. After spending over a thousand pound on a flagship device, that's what happened to me!Very disappointed!Horrible service! Not recommending!"
"Samsung CS is the worst!!  I have been dealing with them unfortunately too many times and this last time I am DONE!!I have had problems with my refrigerator over the last couple of years.  Ice maker died, whole back panel froze over eventually having to have the motherboard replaced.  But the situation that really got me pissed was with my washer.  Now granted, it is 12 years old. I called in for service like I have done several times before and service was scheduled.  Then I received a call from the service company that my case was being sent to the Samsung Exchange dept.  So I spoke with them and they were working on a solution as to the next steps since the part needed (based on my issue description) was no longer made.  The warranty department said they were arranging for a partial refund of the machine.  I got that all squared away and even knew the exact amount of the refund which I thought was very generous for a 12 y/o machine.  I had restored faith in Samsung.  Only that wouldn't last but a day.  I received a text message saying that this was all wrong and I'm not entitled to anything after all.... the machine was too old.  SO you can imagine my anger that this was promised to me without them doing their due diligence on the front end.  This is completely unacceptable and I am SO  upset.  All i got was an apology from the supervisor.  No other accommodation would be made.  I'm DONE with Samsung and told them so.  Stay far away from a company who could care less about Customer service."
"Samsung customer service is terrible. I understand that people are working from home, but if you have screaming kids, crying babies, a constant barking dog and police sirens going down your street, don't keep customers on speakerphone. I couldn't hear a word for the help I called for. I hung up. Id rather go to best buy for help and from now on I'll go with a more professional company when I buy future electronics"
"The worst customer service experience ever.  I called them because the charger for my new phone stopped working.  They said they submitted a ticket to get it ordered. I received no email notice. I called back, and found that no order had been submitted.  They ""submitted"" it again.  Two days go by and no notice was emailed. Called back, again no order had been submitted.  This time, an American sounding supervisor gets on the phone, says the previous representatives didn't submit the order correctly and ensured me she had fixed it.  A week later I get a charger in the mail, but its the wrong one.  This time, I'm currently on my 8th call with the same non-submission issues waiting to see if I can get the correct replacement sent.  This is beyond terrible service.  Its literally made me end my loyalty to Androids.  My next phone in a couple of years will not be a Samsung because of this.  This experience has been stressful and time consuming.  Replacing a charger should be the simplest task, and yet its like pulling teeth with them."
"TOTALLY SH*-T, ARRIVED BOKEN- ABSOLUTELY NO CARE AT ALL FOR GETTING IT FIXED- WE ARE STUCK NOW FOR 2 WEEKS WITH NO WASHING MACHINE- CRAZY TO THINK HOW POPULAR THEY ARE YET HOW POOR THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS- WE SEND IT BACK GET A REFUND AND GO TO SIEMENS OR WHIRPOOL. TOTAL JOKE OF A COMPANY- THAT OLD EXPRESSION IF YOU CANT DO SOMETHING WELL DONT DO IT AT ALL."
"I will never purchase from samsung again. They sent me to a repair center who stated the phone had no liquid damage and needed to be replaced. That wasn't enough for them. They want you to send the phone into their repair center, then make a decision if they want to replace it. First time I have ever went through this with any company and it's the last. GOODBYE SAMSUNG!!"
"Samsung is the worst company I ever had the displeasure of dealing with. We bought a Samsung refrigerator a few years ago and after a couple years the icemaker quit working. Now I have to thaw it out to free up the mechanism to revive it, and this has to be done at least 6 times a month. Its no wonder there is a class action lawsuit against Samsung for this very reason, to which they basically have no response other than to try to get the suit dismissed. So here is a warning; if you are looking for kitchen appliances, DO NOT buy Samsung; in all likelihood you will regret it."
"I've always been a fan of Samsung technology (except phones) and my house is full of Samsung TVs, dishwasher, tumble dryer, and a PC displays.Today was the first time I've ever had to contact their online technical support and I am so disappointed. The guy I spoke to didn't even attempt to work with me to try some possible solutions. I spent just under £1000 on a Samsung 49"" PC Display and am struggling to get it to work with my Dell desktop PC. His solution was to just use it with my Samsung laptop instead. A very unhappy  customer who will no longer be so loyal to Samsung."
"Very bad service from their tech team. Good products worst support team."
"I used to love and have compete faith in my Samsung brand preference.  That is pretty much gone.  I ordered 4 appliances for my kitchen and waited the 2 months for them to be delivered.  (still fine)The delivery guys did great but they were given the wrong dishwasher with my name and tag on it.  Once the box was opened they left it and took my working dishwasher that I had just removed from my kitchen....Samsung expected me to wait until December to get the correct one delivered and just keep a hole in my kitchen.  I asked for a supervisor......good luck.I have now called 3x and used chat 2x in order to get this resolved.  Still no call and no one can do anything but submit a ticket for the supervisor to call me back.  It has now been over a week and I am ready to tell them to come get all their appliances and I will go with someone else."
"After having the cell phone S5, S7, S9 I decided to buy the S20, for my wife my son and mine, Worse mistake, I will stay with my S9, my business is on a 2nd floor and the phone signal does not arrive is on Zero dead, this cell phone costs 1000 when it came out in May, Verizon is selling it at Costco at 349.99, I feel ripped off, by a mediocre and expensive phone, it is only a little faster than the S9. Samsung came to an end. T-Mobile since they bought it, the Germans treat us as ignorant, and stupid, after being with them for 12 years, the problem is that ATT is worse, and Verizon has improved but the post-contract treatment is equal to or worse than T-Mobile . There is nowhere to go."
"If I could give a zero for the customer service I received from Samsung, I would. Specifically for the dryer customer service. Rude! I never received call backs from SUPERVISIORS when they said I would. Horrible experience."
"Good phones and prices Widely available replacement parts too"
"I was have a bad experience or Samsung service I order Samsung watch Samsung AirPods live and the phone z flip I call like 100 time talk to customer service to adjust my price I see them online and I take a picture for it and I send it to Samsung adjust my price they refuse to adjust the price and then I was talking to someone the supervisor to resolve my issue they keep hanging up in my face and the end I talk to specialist supervisor in a sales department after I reserve my own ischio upcoming to return all the products I order from them and I asked him to get me my refund and I never see the bad service in my life like Samsung and I will say to anyone who want to be order any product from Samsung to watch what are they order and what kind of service they have all I know from my experience talking to them I will never order anything from them no more this is my experience for them and I give them zero star for the service and sells department thank you so much for all what you did to me you make me a return on my phone $1500 phone and watch $460 and AirPods live almost 169 I will tell everyone do not order anything from them they all must of my older And  my refund ."
"STAY AWAY!!! Samsung installers damaged my Range.  I am Senior 100% disabled.  I am unable to make something eat.  I don't know what to do?  Someone please help me!!!"
"If I can give no star, I would. Samsung made a request a return label of a $100 order an extreme pain for me. After speaking to 3 agents, the last agent whose name is Luis on the call clearly was driving while taking my call ( can here from the background). He did nothing to resolve the issue and put me on hold every 30 seconds for no reason. Only when I started saying that I will record the call, that he started freaking out. He would not let me complete a customer support survey after the call. It felt really sketchy for Samsung to hire a team of extremely incompetent people as customer supports. For $100, Samsung has lost my business forever."
"It is criminal of a manufacturer that the new models come with an anti-blue light filter that is de-selected by default, and no notification from the phone OS will ever alert the user that the setting needs to be set. I realized this after 6 months I have been using the latest model (shop assistants do not even tell you). I developed a uveitis with cataract and had to go through a surgery within this timeframe. I could not understand why eyes would hurt so much and still have issues. I realized that when I asked a phones shop to move my SIM to an older model. I am sure I am not the only customer, this can create a severely-eye-ill generation of customers . Blu-light filter settings should be either embedded by default or notified with alerts when off. I demand a legal representative from Samsung to contact me immediately."
"They make good products but camera is not really good."
"Worst customer service ever. Technicians never showed up for scheduled/confirmed appointments. Customer service wouldn’t refund the preapproved repair estimates charged to my account.  Agent wouldn’t listen and kept saying I understand but did nothing. Over 30 minutes of “I understand”, “let me call them”, “let me documents this” and nothing was done. I asked for a supervisor multiple times and was told they were busy or on a call. I will never buy another Samsung product."
"The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra delivers the most high-end phone experience money can buy in a year when money is tighter than ever."
"Samsung have the best brand of mobile phones in the world!"
"Camera clarity is really good but portrait mode needs an upgrade. Photo blurred out frequently. And battery issue is there. quick charging helps restoration of power but, how many times should we charge phone in a day? At least twice. However,performance is at its class."
"Good but overpriced products and poor post sales serviceI've bought a few samsung products like phones and tv. They are generally good you will get a hard time to get support for issues."
"I've always found their products to be reliable, durable and excellent value. Fantastic service and no issues with the products whatsoever."
"Claim your company profile to access Trustpilot’s free business tools and start getting closer to your customers today!"
"Samsung will continue to be the leading gadget manufacturer as they are AWSOME."
"I use only their phones because they are powerful, the music sound loudly and they are relaible."
"They're simply terrible. Go with Apple for phone quality and customer support if something goes wrong with your phone. Go LG for TV and appliances. Samsung customer support is pewtrid."
"Samsung are S C U M for both producing the expensive and overpriced Tab S7 with an LCD display when the S7 Plus has an AMOLED, and Samsung force you to sign up for marketing emails to submit product reviews on their website. Samsung Week, a week of offers, also didn't include any tablets. No thanks."
"Every time i get to use products of this brand i am happy, they are really very good and the prices are affordable which is very important for me"
"Samsung Electronics is buy far more exciting then ever I enjoy your products and will continue using it in future."
"Samsung has needs a customer service overhaul. This has been the most annoying, shoddy, and non productive customer service I've ever experienced. The hold/call back times are the absolute worst I've ever seen."
"Went from apple to samsung, very good"
"They sent me a notification to update software. So I downloaded and installed it. After doing so the VPN key icon was moved from left side to the right side. I didn't care. But I can no longer access it through my notification panel to easily disconnect it as I have to do with certain sites/apps. Now I have to locate app to open it to disconnect it. Samsung claims it's Android's problem, not theirs, even though it only happened after I installed Samsung's update. Also, its fingerprint recognition is beyond bad. I never had an issue with my LG phones."
"High prices - Not the best quality Paying more for a better product if fair business. Now when unknown brands make better products than you and you still cost 2x as much? That's just overcharging."
"My Experience With Buying Samsung Products From Refrigerators To Televisions Have Been Very Good Very Sound Products."
"I just purchased a Samsung Smart TV today, works perfect and has amazing resolution and the colors are so vivid 1000 thumbs up great experience."
"ALWAYS good quality products by Samsung from the smartphones to the Tv."
"After how frustrating the service with Verizon has been, Samsung replied that they could not change my phone even with a guarantee and for them to review it I would have to be without a cell phone for 2 weeks. It is dangerous for me to be without it for that long because I have a health condition and I need it for work as well. The other thing is that they could change the battery, and root of the problem but just the same  phone it  would be a tedious way to spend hours without a cell.Can't believe that a company as Samsung is cao much to solve a problem that causing so much trouble to fix an issue that has to do with their bad manufacturing!"
"Great service. Very knowledgeable. Made to feel welcome and to taste the highest quality products. Very helpful and professional. Highly recommended! Better than Apple 🍏 in my opinion!!!"
"You get the amazing screen, great features, quality ,and look."
"The service support you have is pathetic, your service executive themselves don't know the rules. First executive says we don't work on Sundays, another one says we don't work over weekends, Third one say we work on all days of the week. More over the technicians assigned for installation do not bother to pick up the call, no gesture to be supportive and responsive. I made a mistake of buying Samsung product which I would never do again. Just so you know you can cheat one person only one time. If this is how you want to do the business, you will soon be out of race for sure."
"Absolutely the very worst phone and company to deal with.  Bought a new galaxy and, have just thrown it in the bin. What a load of trash. Tried to speak with customer service and got nowhere. Typical of companies that don't give a hoot about customers. Please avoid like the plague. Horrible people."
"worst service(Vijayawada)I gave complaint to Samsung customercare for my refrigerator repair request. They didn’t even come to repair its already 7 days .then I again contacted customer care .they told me that they ordered spare parts for my refrigerator even without coming and checking my refrigerator.they do unnecessary calls at night time that too . They didnt even come till now although I gave complaint 3times. And this is the same i experienced for my tv too. So I request not to buy Samsung products and face trouble and they get repair very easily too."
"Really good quality phones for a fair price. I would purchase always a samsung phone"
"I have a problem with my Galaxy S20 5g where the microphone isn't working. I contacted Samsung as less than 6 months old. They wanted to repair the phone, which was fine, but their authorosed repair agents WeFix had the phone on three separate occasions. Each time stating it is fixed. But after the third repair it was actually worse After spending hours on the telephone I managed to get a samsung customer solutions agent (can't speak to a higher level agent) and all they wanted to do is pass me back down the line to their WeFix repair agents- even tho i have a email from them saying they have changed every component,  please contact samsung for a replacement device!I have to say Samsungs customer service is the worse I have had the mispleasure of interacting with. Their warranties are not worth the paper they are written on, and their repairs are not tested before handing back to the customer. Never again! See you in small claims court... oh yes, I should mention. They don't have an Ombudsmen so I have to take it to court.. for a lousy failed repair!. This is my experience in dealing with them, and I hope I am alone."
"Terrible  customer service.  My galaxy active 2 watch  wouldn't charge.  Long story short they didnt listen to me from the get go and it has now been three weeks without my watch,  they have a tracking # which they can't figure out where it is from cause its not UPS,  spoke with about 7 different reps, none have a clue.    Utterly dissapointing. could have ordered a new charger on amazon  for 12$  and gotten it in two days instead of deal with this incompetence."
"Customer care has no idea what they are doing. I bought a Note 10 plus in 2019 and was trying to use the upgrade program through Samsung and check if I was registered for it. I was told by 3 different agents different answers. At the end of the day I didnt register it for the program. So I decided to do the trade in option to get the Note 20.The Note 10 that was bought unlocked from Samsung, was somehow locked to T-Mobile, called Samsung agent told me I need to go through the carrier I bought it from. After stating to her I bought it from Samsung and as unlocked. She apologized and put me on hold. She then told me once a sim is put in from the carrier it is locked to that network and need to contact tmobile. I submitted it to T-Mobile and ofcourse T-Mobile said it couldn't be unlocked by themselves because it wasn't bought from T-Mobile. Smh what is the point of buying from Samsung, the upgrade option is difficult as is and to have an unlocked phone by locked and cat get a straight answer,  ridiculous."
"Great technology, I'm currently using Samsung Galaxy A20 and its really amazing. And your Tv has good pixel which makes watching better in quality and the sound is better so i don't have to visit theater especially this corona times."
"Horrific customer service experience.In July I left my Samsung galaxy 10 note in my car for about 4-5 hours. When I found it it had completely melted, like you put a lighter to it, a big yellow streak across the front screen, but the back of it was utterly damaged and parts had dissolved from the heat. It is a dangerous phone which I paid 1400 for. I tried speaking to customer service over 30 times over a 3 month period. They asked me to mail it in. I shipped it to them, they had it for 3 days, they sent it back to me, no explanation or plan of action, I've never heard back from anyone again. Not corporate, not a single human being. I keep calling customer service, they'd transfer me to the dep. that deals with damages, they'd say it will be escalated and someone will call me in 3 days I've never heard from anyone. This issue has been escalated over 20 times, but still not a single reply from anyone. This is the worst company that I've ever had to deal with. They don't care about the customer, the product is inferior and flammable. It caused a huge hole in my leather seat, which was caused by the melting phone. This phone is dangerous and could have caused a lot greater damage if I hadn't found it in time. The least they can do is give me my money back. I've been a loyal customer for 10 years, and this is how they treat me. They are evil, money-hungry, and corrupt. What they've done to me is corrupt, especially since my phone is still under warranty and they can replace it or refund me, but they choose to treat me like an absolute nobody. Please buy your phone from any other company than Samsung, because on hot days if you leave that phone in your car, it will completely melt, melt your seat, and cause thousands of dollars of damage. if I hadn't caught it in time it would have set my car on fire. But customer service will not care, and you will never hear from them again. Please don't be a fool and spend a small fortune on a phone ($1,400) that cannot stand the heat, that will melt and damage your property extensively, and the company will do nothing about it, and ignore you 100 percent. They are not decent, have no integrity, morals, or values, They will sell you a cheap flammable product, and in the end, you will be treated like trash."
"Samsung has what I believe to be the worse customer service I’ve ever experienced. I purchased a new 65 inch Samsung TV for the up coming football season.. It went dark after about two months. I’m in my four week waiting after countless messages and phone calls to Samsung! Finally, they’re agreed to to refund the present value of the TV! Of course that will take another 2 to 3 weeks! Unbelievable! I’m sure they will be fine without my business because another Samsung product will never enter my house."
"I have been using Galaxy S8 for many years and I think this is the best smartphone I've ever had!"
"Two weeks now I’ve waited for a message, email from Samsung Customer services they said they would get back to me over my issues with a brand new 55 inch 8K tv that was faulty in the first week then continued to fault for the next three weeks then I took it back to Currys and no communication from them either Take my advice and take your money else where don’t buy Samsung and especially from curry’s"
"I would not ever buy anything from this company again as they don’t give your free rewards after you buy a phone off them there saying well your times run out to claim it how can it run out when I claimed it the day I bought the phone Well I did all that and they still don’t want to give it me Reward fulfilment for Participants purchasing from Samsung Shop Online (UK)9. Participants purchasing from the Samsung Shop Online (UK) must select their Rewards when placing their pre order.  Their Reward will be dispatched within 45 days of selection (the GamePass Ultimate code will not be sent before 15 September) I did that"
"The products are there good, but the support is poor, unfriendly and rude!"
"Ordered Samsung microwave at Samsung.com  They set delivery date more than 3 weeks later.  On the day before delivery they changed to an even later delivery.  Called customer service (which sucks) and was told the missed delivery was because my order was not in the system.  I do not reccomend using Samsung.Com"
"Urgently read this before buying. I had to give a one star just to write a review.Before buying a Samsung fridge freezer or washing machines please read my experience .My fridge freezer ice compartment went faulty, so Samsung changed my fridge for a new one. However, it went faulty straight away. I had plastic in my ice, even though the first engineer could not find it. However, with persistence FX sent out another engineer who found the fault. So I took a photo of the part proving plastic falling off the part as it was still attached .Although they changed the part, I was still getting plastic in the fridge . I have been told by an engineer that this is a common fault of Samsung. However, Samsung are denying any fault and won’t admit to my evidence and are denying it.Then one of my freezers has started to only semi freeze, the engineer found the fault but told me he needed someone more experienced to fix it.Samsung again has told me no fault was found even though the engineer took the temperature and informed me there was a fault.Now I have condensation forming and the seal seems to be not working.Samsung will not send out anymore engineers and will not honour my 5 year warranty. The warranty means nothing. They won’t repair my washing machine even though I have not reported any fault before.Anyone out there with similar issues as I would like to go to small no claims court."
"I purchased the $1400 S20 in May 2020. In June 2020 The screen cracked and I was told to send it in for repair.  Although I was skeptical I sent it in. I received a notification the phone was in transit back to me via UPS. It is now Oct 2020 and I have yet to receive my phone. I have been back and forth with samsung and UPS concerning my phone for 4 months and counting. Their reps Managers continue to lie stating they'll look into it and call me back. It doesn't make sense to have to repeat yourself to 3 different individuals each time to get to a manager and then for him to to hang up or lie and say someone will contact you."
"Terrible customer service. Our washing mashine broke in June, only three years old. I contacted customer service multiple times, and did not get any help. Four months later, i still have not recived any reply, and we had to buy a new washing mashine from different Brand. I would never buy or reccomend any Samsung products again."
"I bought my Galaxy A90 in December 2019 . after 6 month later the screen went completely blank and then I spoke to the customer support team then they arranged for the collection. After 4 days later they fixed the screen and returned it to me then after 2 month later I had same problem again then I had to do the same procedure again and after second time is been fixed then I had same issue in the 3rd time in 10 weeks .  then I try to call them day after day nobody answer  on the 5th day of calling sumsung someone answered and said to me sorry we are all working from home that's why no one answer your call anyway after I explained the situation I ask for replacement he said no, then I ask for speak to the manager then he said he will call you within 24HRs then I said said ok fine . I was expecting a call but nobody call me. Next days  some body called me then I explained the situation and ask for replacement becouse keep happening same problem then  he said to me  speak to your retailer then I spoke to the retailer the retailer said we  can't help you with this . This device is under warranty they should replace the device oh god sake then I try to call samsung support I couldn't get through then day after some body answer my call then I explained everything and ask for replacement and then he said we are manufacturer we can't replace your device speak to retailer then I had enough..........now I'm going to report trading standard agency let's see can they do something about it."
"I've been using my Samsung galaxy tab S5E and up until now, I'm still impress to it's performance. I'm not regretting choosing this and I'm satisfied using this everyday. For those who are looking for a tablet especially for online class, this is so perfect."

"My phone died after 2 years!... It was perfect no viruses etc. And it just shut down randomly... Thanks samsung! And now I`ve been with an old samsung phone since 10 months from now!RIP S7 Edge 2017 DEC - 2019 DEC / 2020 JAN"
"Got a tablet recently and was negatively surprised that they aren't considering putting extra nibs for the s-pen. I mean, the nib which goes in the package will last for several months only, and what then? Then I have to buy another pen for and extra 50 bucks? That it weird guys."
"a week ago my samsung note 10 plus 5g started having a issue charging it said the temperature of the phone was to cold to charge so it is only at 1 percent at all times and has to be plugged in. i called samsung support for help and i told them my problem they were super helful, but it didn't resolve the issue. the tech over the phone said it might be covered in warranty and i had to go to one of their prefered repair places in seattle called u break it i fix it. i went to u break it i fix it and they confirmed it wasn't something that i did it was a manufacturing issue so i would need to contact Samsung to get it fixed or receive a new phone per the warranty. i called samsung and they said it would take 2 weeks for me to get my phone back i asked if they are able to send out a loaner phone while my phone is gone i am super reliant on my phone for my career so not having my phone for 2 weeks would not be a option. they said they don't offer loaner phones at all. i said so you don't offer loaner phones even though it was a manufacturing issue? they said no. so now i'm a bit shocked i asked what they suggested i do. they suggested i go to a store and buy another samsung phone until my phonen is repaired and sent back. i asked if that was something that they were able to refund the price of since i do need a smart phone to operate at work they said they could not refund me the price of the new phone i will be using for 2 weeks. i just think that for a 290+ billion dollar company having loaner phones for manufacuring issues should be standard and they certainly should not suggest buying another samsung device as a reasonable solution to their improper building of a new phone."
"A week ago I called customer service and informed them of a issue I was having with the Galaxy Buds plus Ear buds I also informed them that these buds were a Gifted to me and had no POD.  They process my request with no issue I was under the impression that they would honor my warranty issue. I sent them in at their cost 2nd day air. And 4 days later they informed me that my earbuds are not under warranty and then they tried to charge me to repair the headsets At a cost more expensive then a new pair would have cost me.I think they could of save me the time and their money if they would ask me for more information instead of leading me on, that this would be taken care of warranty.Such poor Customer service from a Big Company like Samsung:("
"I purchased a refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. It's taken me 2 weeks to try to register for the 1 year warranty. They make it very difficult to register so they don't have to warranty your product. Read reviews of their appliances and you'll know why. I tried to get verification that my range and microwave were warranted because initially they said I didn't have the receipt. The stove, frig & dishwasher were on the SAME receipt. The microwave was ordered online and they keep asking for the store location. If you go on their website, they make it very difficult to try to talk to someone about your warranty which is a clue they don't really want to warranty their appliances."
"A multibillion company that could save the world."
"The TV I bought less than 90 days earlier failed, it wouldnt stay powered up. Since I didnt pay the extra $$ for the ""Best Buy"" extended warranty I had to deal with samsung directly. What a pain in the azz that was. They told me someone would contact me within 3-5 days, that never happened. All I wanted was an ""RA"" number so I caould swap it out. On one of the calls I was given an RA # but when I got to Best Buy with it, the number wasn't recognized. two days later I go through the same routine, get to Best Buy and the number still isn't working. That was 20 minutes after I was told by them it would. After some less than nice talk they put me through to some other person who managed to give me a different number that the guys at best buy were able to use. Basically, I was without a TV for 7 days when I shouldve been able to swap it out the first day. So much for using proper protocols, next time I'll just buy a replacement and just return the bad one."
"DO NOT TRUST SAMSUNG APPLIANCES.I purchased many Samsung appliances but the worst experience I had was with there Gas stove. They never fixed or honored there warranty. Because of the severity of a Gas leak I had to throw out the 4 month old stove and replace it with another Brand.Samsung does not make reliable appliances. I purchased 2 of the same  refrigerators with ice makers, both broke down with the same exact issues. Cracked inside back wall because they use cheap china plastic and ice makers leak and freeze up. Only good for 6 months. If you should buy their product make sure you buy outside source warranty.I dealt with their customer service in New Jersey and I rate them 0. Never resolved my issues.70% Bad reviews you understand why. You need to read the reviews on any product before you shop"
"Used to be a loyal samsung consumer! Not anymore. Very upset with purchases & horrible customer service from samsung.com .  I'll no longer purchase any Samsung products.  They refuse to send me an exchange on a defective dryer that was sent out to me. They are giving me the run around on a refund. Samsung sent out a tech to replace the washer door because it arrived with a chip on it. This was 13 days after I received my order & that tech refused to look at the dryer saying it wasn't on his ticket (I was told both would be). Now i have to wait maybe another 2 weeks for another technician?  This isn't cool. I also ordered an entire kitchen set (dishwasher, microwave, oven, fridge) that was supposed to be delivered today & theres no sight of that. I wonder how many days late that order will be. Placed the order on August 24th & delivery date was supposed to be today September 16th (23 days later) and they still can't make it on time. Currently on hold for 57 minutes to speak to an agent. This is my 5th time calling samsung & I keep getting the run around. As if my time isn't valuable. Took the day off from work to be here for a delivery as well & that didn't happen. Let's see how much more headache & hassle they give me. Im very displeased. I have 5 samsung tvs & multiple other products as i try to buy exclusively from samsung.Never owned an iPhone but will be buying one next. Just got off the phone after 2 hours of back & forth i finally got them to agree to a refund & pickup of their product. We will see how that part of the process goes."
"If there was negative stars to give, I would give that for Samsung. Worst customer service and horrible electronics that die quickly and are overpriced for the quality. Never will I buy from them again. Absolutely horrible."
"I don't recommend any Samsung product they do not stand behind there products and customer service is horrible and unprofessional company im stuck with a defective s-20 ultra...don't forget about the bombs they sold #note9...its time to go to apple"
"Purchased a Samsung 8+ and I am Happy!I would love to be able to change the battery manually but since its now ""normal"" to rather buy a new one its still very good compared to others"
"Just read the other reviews. Customer service is HORRIBLE. They don’t care. They don’t commit to their promise. Idk why ppl still purchase this brand. I will NEVER AGAIN.  The entire company especially customer service needs to be retrained in long term retention, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. But we can clearly see they don’t care. No one from the company even reply back in here. That shows how much they care."
"Three and Samsung cancelled the purchase of my daughter's 15th birthday giftI wanted to buy a cell phone for my daughter's 15th birthday present at Three.I made the purchase online, chose the cell phone (Samsung S20 Ultra), chose the plan and made the purchase. I even made an advance payment.My daughter didn't even sleep waiting for us to get her cell phone at Three store in Liverpool.It was too long. After two days, I received a message from Samsung saying that my purchase was cancelled. I didn't know why they cancelled!!! They said in the email I received: ""..... I am unable to discuss the specific reason why we rejected your application"".I thought what happened was absurd and my daughter was very sad.I didn't know why. I don't have and never had a payment problem. They did not want to sell a simple cell phone with payment of £55.00 a month !!!!!Samsung and Three uses an outdated criterion to evaluate consumers and sell cell phones.Immediately I went to the Apple store in Liverpool One and bought an iPhone 11 Pro Max in cash and gave it to my daughter and obviously I won't be using the Three.I'm telling everyone about my family and friends. I even made sure that some friends did not buy the Three monthly plan.This was my Samsung and Three evaluation criterion, unlike those who did not tell me or why they cancelled my purchase.They do not respect and value the consumer. That is why they have already lost sales to competitors. And Samsung and Three will continue to lose customers to competitors."
"I wished I had an option of negative rating for their services. It’s the sEcond time I have faced a problem. Before this in the year 2016 I faced an issue with my refrigerator it took me 3 months to get it sorted.I followed them up repeatedly. It’s such a waste of time energy.Now since August 2020 I have registered a complaint again with respect to my refrigerator they haven’t sorted my issue yet, it’s September 2020. I have registered 3 complaints in this period. They have cancelled my request by giving false statements that the client did not pick up the call after repeated number of times they tried to contact me. Second time they mentioned that the complaint is taken care of and sorted and closed my complaint without sending any technician to my place. It’s funny. LIES! Like really!I really will never recommend purchase of any Samsung Product. Because if the after sale services are so worst there’s no point buying the product at the first place. Highly disappointed. Pathetic services!"
"Samsung products are really not cool. First of all, repairing my samsung broken phone screen cost me a huge amount of money.Secondly, I used my phone for a month and it started developing issues.I believe samsung can get better. I've always wanted a great Samsung phone that'll make give them a five star rating. Samsung is a good company. They were better before, and they'll improve someday.Thanks"
"- My entire order history has disappeared- Change terms on promotions without prior notifications to customers- God awful customer supportBuy their products from resellers only, never had a good experience with their eCommerce operations in 10 years now."
"Horrendous service. Doesn't care about clients! I regret my Note 20 tremendously! Do not support, Huawei is soooooo much better, they actually do what they say they're going to!!!Went online to Vodacom website to purchase a Note 20, online, the offer was for a R3999 voucher. Phoned my Vodacom store, because we only go through one specific person. The person confirmed in store for me that the voucher is legit, and I must just go to Samsung members to redeem my voucher. I didn't buy a cover in store, because of the voucher. Didn't really have money to spend on a cover. Note on Samsung members there was no voucher it was only the sterilizer, so I had no choice but to apply for it. Had to go and spend R600 on a new cover now. Then after waiting a week for my coupon for my promised sterilizer, didn't receive anything. I got a reference code and nothing more. I phone a week after submission. The guy on the phone informed me that he will escalate the issue, and I will receive notification in a day or two and I will get my link, I am now sitting 3 days later with no link, no coupon. The customer representative gave me excuses, and basically just blamed Vodacom for not putting period of validity. And even after I sat on the phone for 10 minutes trying to find out what the status of my request is. Turns out he was looking at the won't list, so he just wasted 10 minutes of my airtime, for nothing! I have had no contact for the item I was supposed to receive with my phone. Not had anyone been willing to assist me with the voucher that I was promised, and they were your airtime.DO NOT SUPPORT, IF I WASNT ON CONTACT, I WOULD RETURN THIS GOD DAMN PHONE AND SWITCH TO HUAWEI"
"Purchased a fridge from Samsung.com (£700)  as I'm a big fan of Samsung products. It arrived on time and happy with the service.Then within 7 days later the price had dropped quite considerably.I emailed them to ask if they can help in this matter and if they could refund me the difference as I was quite upset that the price had dropped within just 7 days. They said no and wanted me to return the fridge (now used) to them as I was well within the 30 days return period and to reorder the fridge again at the lower price!This makes absolute so sense. They would incur costs for the courier to collect and would need to resell a used fridge at a much lower price. Other online stores would refund no problem. Samsung please review your policies."
"Bought a frame for a tv on their website. They had no problem taking the money but i havent got any goods. So basicly they have stolen the money. Costumer service arent doing anything about it and told me to wait several weeks and then see if i have gotten a refound or the goods. So if u want to waste your money samsung is the way to go."
"Brought a 2019 QLED Q70 65” tv back in March and within a month developed a fault had a company that Samsung sent over to repair the television 7 time’s and still the issue is present engineer put a request in for a replacement tv as coming over 7 time’s is ridiculous which was denied by Samsung do not buy a Samsung tv wish I’d brought an LG or something else. Now £1,000 out of pocket with a tv that doesn’t work and Samsung has no intention or interest in fixing it brought directly from them as as well"
"I always prefer Samsung devices rather than any other company even though for me I still believe that they can improve their products. Excellent service. Very knowledgable, helpful and professional."
"The worst customer service experience ever. The process of trying to get into my account is ridiculous and I had the right password. The keep sending a code to an old number. To to reset my account it takes 48hrs. I'm with them."
"Samsung has the worst customer service of all phone company I bought a Samsung Galaxy note 20 ultra 5G 512 gig and the camera don't work properly and Samsung refused to give me a replacement I had the phone for less than 5 days this is really disappointing they said I can return it but I would be out of a phone for like 7 to 14 days unacceptable"
"Love. Just love. I cannot complain about their customer service, for me it has been both good and fast. Let's not talk about quality, it's very very good. The only thing that they can work on is their prices, in ALL products, but honestly.. even in that they've been improving."
"Samsung has the WORST customer service experience ever. I tried to use the warranty on a tablet I purchased less than a year ago and was told I would get a refund within 7-10 business days because they did not have anymore of the items I purchased. It’s been almost 3 months and I never got my refund and I have called 6 times since the first call and I get transferred for over an hr each time before  someone hangs up"
"We bought a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 in Dec 2019 and by May of 2020 it completely stopped working. I first attempted to find the information I needed to send the watch for warranty repair through chat. The woman at ""customer service"" immediately told me that they do not repair a watch that we have signs of physical damage. I told her the watch had no physical damage at all; then she moved to say that we caused water damage. I told her that we didn't and that the watch is supposed to be 50M water resistant and we have not submerged it in even 6 inches of water. She insisted and would not give me the information to return the watch. I had to be borderline rude and told her to stop putting words in my mouth that I never said and to give me the information I was looking for. After much waiting time and run around trying to get a hold of somebody that could honor the warranty, we finally sent the watch over only to receive an email saying that the watch has water damage so our warranty was voided and we would have to pay $241 to repair it. The watch, which is supposed to be water resistant to 50M, was never submerged in the water. We called, received more run around, and finally talk to somebody and told them it was impossible for us to have caused the damaged and perhaps it is a manufacturing flaw. After a short 2 minutes hold for them to think it over, they said...""either pay to repair it or we will send it back to you with a voided warranty."" I give them ZERO stars... their customer service is awful, they refuse to honor warranties, the waiting time is ridiculous, we got cut off around 5 times before we could finally get through, the RSI department is incompetent or have been trained to lie and try to make their customers pay for the repair and never actually spoke with us but only left notes and sent messages to other representatives. I was going to get the new Galaxy watch for me and the new Note20 but I have completely changed my mind. I wasted $400 on a piece of crap watch and would not waste another penny in ANY Samsung product."
"We purchased a Samsung fridge and range February 2018, black stainless steel, or so we thought. The oven door is now peeling. How does stainless steel peel!? Samsung will not do anything about it as its cosmetic. I’m extremely upset and disappointed with this product, I will never buy Samsung again. Leon’s is where we purchased the set and they won’t have anything to do with it, now I have a $1000 pc of crap sitting in my kitchen. I guess I’ll just sit back and wait for my fridge to start peeling as well,  then I’ll have a matching set again, 😡. Conversation with Samsung customer service:“Simon: The unit is out of warranty, the service will be chargeable.The authorized service center details areKens Appliance Repaircontact them and get the service appointment fixed at the earliest.Linda: So I have to pay for a manufacture defect? Simon: I certainly understand your concern but Samsung makes sure all the products undergo several tests and all are tested under good quality before shipping the product. L: It was fine when we first rec'd it, I only clean it with soap and water, I don't understand how the paint can just start peeling off. Simon: it completely depends upon the maintenance.L: Maintenance by whom? L: Most people wipe down their appliances. Is this not recommended?Simon: I understand you're concern but peeling off comes under cosmetic damage and Samsung doesn't cover cosmetic damages under warranty.”I’m getting very frustrated purchasing what I thought were good products (for the price) to have them become defective or fall apart in less than a couple of years with no replacement of any kind, no customer service and basically lied too about the products we purchased."
"I registered a 5 year extended warranty on purchase of my washing machine in Nov 2015. Contacting the customer service to arrange a repair, I was told the machine was not in warranty, after supplying the copy of email of certificate of warranty I was told they had updated the system. After 2 more calls they have still not done this. This is the worse customer care of any company I have had the misfortune to use. Avoid Samsung."
"Purchased a Galaxy S20 Ultra Unlocked and a Watch 2 Active LTE earlier this year. Pre-ordered both of them based on the claims the company (Samsung) made about both products... Now, nearly a year later, both products don't function the way they were advertised: the Watch Active 2 is still missing the fall detection, the ECG and Blood Pressure monitor and the S20 Ultra has a camera that doesn't work properly, still doesn't have RCS and is missing the functionality of Standalone 5G.I reached out to Samsung on multiple occasions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic and the result is always the same, old runaround, empty promises ""to do better"", even emptier apologies and, most of the time, no help at all. I believe that I am entitled to some answers as a customer who purchased thousands of dollars worth of Samsung products over the years.Samsung customer care didn't get back to me as promised, their forums are a black hole of emptiness, their supervisors are as inept as their reps and, basically, no one can give me any answers, offer absolutely any solutions or provide help of any kind. I hope they get hit with a class-action lawsuit, I really do. As far as my defective, partially-functioning products go, I am planning on filing a claim against them shortly. My advice to anyone planning to buy from Samsung is that they should go with any other company or, at least, a company that knows what it's doing."
"Do NOT buy the expensive Samsung Ecobubble  Q drive washing machine we have had nothing but problems with it and Samsung customer care are shocking they refuse to fix it. In less than 12 months we had 3 issues with it and Samsung refused to fix them saying it was our fault !! We bought it from John Lewis and they should be ashamed of the products they are selling. Never ever will we ever buy a Samsung product and no one else should waste their money on them .."
"Built to fail - I bought my Galaxy S8 about 18 months ago. The battery is swelling up and pushing the back cover off. I went online and was shocked to read this is a common fault with other Galaxy models. I tried to contact them and was given the runaround."
"I love this brand and their products! Mainly the samsung smartphones! Like Note and S series!"
"Beware of Samsung customer service if you have any of their home appliance products.  I have a Samsung French door fridge that just turned 5 years old.  The ice house, evaporator cover and defrost system are all known to be defective and Samsung has acknowledged this.  I had a Samsung tech at my house to confirm this, and they drafted a memo for me to show to Samsung support confirming the issues.  I spent 7 total hours on the phone with Samsung over 45 days.  They opened 4 separate ticket numbers for me and each one was elevated to “case management” with a guaranteed call back of no more than 3 business days.  Each time no one called me back, so I would call in about 5 business days later to find out they cancelled my ticket with no callback ALL 4 TIMES. One rep told me they would replace the parts, but then again, no call back.  On my final attempt a “case manager” gave me a final answer that they won’t cover anything at all because the fridge was bought at HH Greg who is now out of business, so the purchase couldn’t be verified.  An absolutely pathetic excuse for customer service, their fallback was unable to prove the purchase after a Samsung tech confirmed the problem with the product serial number?  They admit their parts are defective but don’t stand behind the customer or the product.  By the way, these parts alone are almost $900.  Don’t waste your money on their home appliances."
"I've loved Samsung phones since I owned a D500 slider phone and have upgraded through the years to the phone I have now a Galaxy S10 plus which worked fine until April 2020 then after a major software update I started having problem with predictive text on the 3/4 keyboard my phone has been to a Samsung service centre 4 times and every time has come back with the same issue, today I went into a three mobile store and realised the New S20 models have the same issue, so it appears Samsung are unaware of this or don't want to admit it,my issue is when I type a word I'll get a word not in context or totally bizarre ie if I type piggy it will put in schizophrenia, if I type ""at"" it will put in ""but"", and on and on etc etc, one of the Samsung support team said to me ""why don't you just use the qwerty keyboard""? That's like me saying why don't you use your left hand when your right handed. It's frustrating having to go back and put in the correct words by dragging them into place and proof reading before you press send."
"What a POS company this is. It's all about the money for them. I sent them my Samsung smartwatch which fails to power up. They informed me it was going to be $117 to fix. Okay. Samsung then sent me an email with an invoice for $177 for the repair. I can buy a brand new watch for $197 on eBay with a one year warranty. Why would I want to spend $177 for something a year and a half old that they only offer a three month repair warranty on? I told them to shove it and send it back to me ASAP. The idiot girl that answered the phone couldn't answer a single question of mine without putting me on hold for 5 minutes each time. They need to do some serious training."
"Samsung has got to be the worst customer service place possible. They are not reliable and always want to charge to fix with or without a warranty. They are all about the money and don’t care about providing honest and fair customer service. I will no longer buy their products, they are way too faulty and unreliable."
"My dryer has been stopped working more then 2 weeks and I've called Samsung customer service 3 times and 18th of August: I wrote 2 emails. I also tried to connect them via online chat. I've got nothing except for their non-sense words. Really frustrating situation.It seems big companies pay less attention to their customer service quality.I know they don't care about customers review here because you cannot see any answer to people's complaints here.Update: 8th of September: I have not heard from Samsung' customer service yet.Please,  DON'T BUY SAMSUNG."
"Been dealing with them from April ! Yet to replace the right phone .. nobody knows what they are doing. They said they would Replace the phone with the same or higher model since it was under Warranty and then sends a lower model and each time we have had to call .. them the same story is repeated and then there usual comment is we have put in request and someone will get back to u in 2 weeks .. We’ll surprise .. no one ever does IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD ! Either replace ur incompetent staff ! Or update your systems to improve your internal communications and if you’ll say something will be done DO IT Just DO YOUR JOB !"
"samsung is hands-down the worst support I have ever received by any company.  Something minor needed to be fixed with my monitor just after two weeks of purchasing.  I had to pay for shipping back to get it fixed, then when received the item they claimed that there was screen damage and it's no longer in warranty.  They refused to provide me with photo evidence.  Had to file claims with samsung, UPS, and my credit card company.  I have made over 25 calls and no one is competent enough to know what is going on.  I even received multiple mixed emails and text from samsung contradicting one another (saying it's fixed, saying it's not, saying I get one-time service, saying I have to pay more money).  I will NEVER buy another samsung product again.  In fact, I refuse to capitalize their name as you can tell from this write-up."
"Pathetic. My year-old Samsung TV just died, completely. It has a 3-year Samsung warranty. After 33 days, 1 canceled service visit, and 3 actual service visits with 2 parts replaced (all costing Samsung many times the cost of a new TV), they finally said they need to replace the TV. But, I need to wait to receive a call from the Exchange team, who will give me ""information"" and will then hand off to some other team for the next step. Because that's ""the process."""
"I purchased a 10.1 32GB tablet from Samsung early this year. It was to be a gift for my Grandson however, he received one from his Father a few days earlier so I returned the tablet to Samsung. They received the product 05/07/2020 @10:29 AM and signed for by Fisher verified by UPS tracking # 1Z440RX50303156015. Samsung acknowledges receipt of product so we both agree on that point! However, they say they cant find the product and are still looking for it. In other words it has been misplaced somewhere in their warehouse which in their opinion is somehow my fault.  They refuse to reimburse me until they find the tablet. Bottom line is they have my money and my tablet!                                                Bill Wilson"

"Horrible QC. Samsung won’t honor warrantyi received the 2019 65” RU800 TV as a gift. Right out of the box, there was a Picture issue. I spent hours in the phone, on hold and troubleshooting, with three diff samsung reps, sent photos, and they finally assured me this was under warranty and would be repaired. The warranty company reached out to tell me samsung denied the claim and sent me back to take it up with Samsung. After speaking With two more reps, I am at a dead end with a brand new tv that is unusable, and have no recourse. They accused me of doing the damage, but there no visible damage to the unit, only picture issues when its powered on. I will never buy another Samsung product. I hope noone else has this issue. I’ll def advocate to seek another brand anytime and every time.When I tried to post on their reviews, they censored my post and refused to publish it.  Imagine that."
"Honestly if I could put no starts I would. First of all they advertise  there phone as water resistant  so when I accidentally  dropped it in the pool it was completely ruined even though it was in there for a couple minutes. It was completely ruined won't even turn on another screens all black so I give it to the samsung shop hoping to fix it they wanted to charge me $600 I can get a new phone with that tried to get ahold of them for 4 days to see why they are charging that and they tell me the mother load is broken and everytime I call they can't help they have to transfer but that person can't help either. So after on hold for multiple hours and days I tell them to send it back I'm not paying I receive it back and it works with out even paying but they back of my phone is all cracked and not even glued on good and I call and they tell me cause I never paid to get it fixed they cant do anything about the cracked screen that they broke. Worst service ever definatly moving to apple they don't have ceaph customer service samsung doesn't even care or take  care of there customers"
"I am very happy with the samsung devices I am using at home. However they should improve their customer support."
"Called for service and was hung up by john, so unprofessional when.i called back they stated that it was a system glitch, I asked to be transferred to a dept and was denied and also wanted to speak to supervisor and was also denied.  Bad customer service"
"HANDS DOWN BEST COMPANY IVE EVER BOUGHT FROM. If only they would give me products to test I’d let everyone know about how great they really are!"
"Bought a washer and dryer from Samsung thinking it’s the best quality. Within a year the washer stopped working, it’s been three Months and no service person has showed up to service it and no one is helping out to expedite it. Never again buying Samsung appliance.All you get from them is ‘sincere apologies” which basically useless. Bought it from Home Depot. I have been bounced from Samsung to service centers to Home Depot customer service without anyone taking ownership.Very very very bad customer service and unreliable product . Pathetic experience . I should have stuck to GE instead of experimenting With Samsung which is more costly."
"When I moved into my new house I did some research on new kitchen appliances and was excited to find that Samsung seemed to be the best quality for what I was looking to spend. I purchased a new refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher from Samsung which unfortunately has been my biggest regret as a new homeowner. After 5 short months  my dishwasher started leaking, so much that my kitchen floor now has a giant bubble in it. Trying to work with Samsung’s customer service department has been nothing but frustrating. I have now been through three long months of numerous employees giving me different and contradicting reasons why Samsung will not replace their 5 month old product that is no longer working and has ruined my kitchen floor. I would not recommend Samsung appliances to anyone. Please, take it from me, you will not regret spending a little extra money on a product that will actually last or buying from a company that will not make you jump through hoops after you have spent thousands of dollars investing in their products! So disappointing!!"
"I just have to say that I have been buying Samsung devises for many years and I was always happy with every item I bought. Recently we bought few new devices for our home and everything works perfectly, I just had to give back appreciation. :) Thank you Samsung!"
"Best quality in all products and services"
"I have a Samsung TV, so far I had nothing to complain about, but then I had a message poping up every 30s, saying my extra service is over. I can't close it and it blcoks all the functions of the remote.I tried to call the customer service, as usual, I had to press 4 differnent buttons, and I have waited 20 minutes, without any kind of indication of the time I have to wait.THen I tried with the online chat, they first asked me the number of my device.( it is very convenient fir the user to hide your tv id , behind, the tv, written in small).THen I described my problem, provided my contact details, and once I did all of this, they tell me nobody is available : so first of all, they lie about the availability of the service, and secondly just tell me there is nobody available before to ask me all the details. If your customer service is usless, at least don't waist the ime of your customer"
"Awful customer service after buying a fridge for over £1000. Still no help/replacement or any meaningful dialogue with this company despite the product being well within warranty."
"I saw some color loss after just boiling water on my range! It happened only after using it for a month and a half. I called BestBuy and they told me it should resist the heat and there should not be any color loss. They recommended calling Samsung. I called Samsung and they told me it was a stain. I kept telling them it was not a stain. Then, they sent a technician to look at it. The technician came in and after talking to Samsung over the phone, told me there was nothing he could do. He said it looked like it was used properly but Samsung does not cover it. What a cheap and terrible company. I did not have this problem when I had the Whirlpool range. Do not buy Samsung and look for other brands!"
"My hot surface light does not turn off and because of this i am not able to use the self cleaning.  I called customer service and asked to talk to a manager.  The CSR said one would call me back and they never did.  I called back a week later and the manager said there is nothing he could do since it is over a year old.  The repairs will cost $350 and I only paid $600 for the stove.   This is the second time I have had this issue with this stove which is just over 2 years old.  Total repairs will be more than what I paid for the stove. Time to buy a new stove again and it will not be a Samsung."
"Recent update to Samsung Galaxy S10E made my screen weird. The colours on the screen look greenish flush in colour. Contacted support on chat and they told me to do factory reset blah blah blah. I did all that and it did not work and then they told me to bring down to service center for inspect. Since it was outside of warranty period of 12 months I need to pay for the inspection. This is ridiculous. Your update broke my phone... why the heck should I have to pay for it????"
"Company only sale the products not clear to warranty before salening time,any esu for after purchase told sir it's a not warranted because it's  trangect damage not company side fold.so pay the money this matiriyal.chit to customer."
"Very good customer service , good performance of electronics ,good results by this company products.   My username in paidera is : Sai ram devarapally"
"Bought a galaxy A40 phone within a month of purchasing it the camera doesbt work and the health app doesnt count any kind of activity,distance or even steps  . Contacting customer service is a nightmare as you spend two hours repeating everything and failing to get anything resolved Comedy highlight of  the conversation was being told by Samsung to contact the app manufacturer of Samsung Health🤣🤣if you want incompetent customer service and badly made products that develop faults within a month of purchase then go to Samsung as they care little about their customers"
"TRY getting through to customer support .. so much fun. I have been online with chat.. which is useless and then attempted to call in. on hold for 93 minutes and got disconnected. all I want is a dimension on a dryer installation which they dont have in their specs.I almost want to return the dryer..so frustrated. beyond annoyed. Now I called back again and I am on hold again for over 43 minutes .. waiting to talk to someone. never again.this time I tried getting them to call me and hold my place in line -- the phone connected and is just ringing out for 13 minutes."
"Samsung usually makes good products, but not always. And when they make bad products,their products fails/breaks due to bad software/low quality,or when their phones and so on are just a year or two old,Samsung does not take responsibility and they fail to take care of their customers time after time: I have a Samsung hard drive for online backup that never worked, and Samsung just quit trying to make it work. I have a Samsung Watch that the strap just rotted and broke on.I have a Blu-Ray drive that Samsung did not bother with making work with Windows 10. I have several Samsung top model mobile phones that Samsung quit updating both Android and security updates on after just a few years.I have a Samsung phone that the screen just quit working on,and Samsung blamed an unrelated damage on the phone without even trying to make probable that the two faults were related!And so on..."
"We've made a decision today. After 8 months trying to work with Samsung on an issue that was entirely their fault, we will no longer buy any Samsung products. They even went so far as firing a guy who did his job by helping us and after that canceled the ticket and closed the case without notifying us. This is their customer service nightmare after the sale. This was what we got for buying a washer/dryer set. We have 2 Samsung large screen smart TVs,  3 tablets, and smart phones (latest upgrades). We're done. Our next phone upgrades will not be Samsung. No more Samsung. Even authorized dealerships hate dealing with them. One dealership we spoke to dropped their lines of appliances. We're dropping them too. Support after sale is a nightmare and that's an understatement."
"I bought a Samsung  65 inch tv, after two years I got a single white spot on the screen, 2 more years pass, now there are four white spots, called Samsung, they said it was out of warranty, nothing they could do. Don’t buy a Samsung tv, they are poorly made, I think a 2000 dollar tv should last longer than two years."
"I have been using samsung smartphone for a few years now, and I have to admit that it is trustworthy gadget!"
"Bought a Samsung 75"" tv. It is not compatible with my iptv stb, even though it works fine on my 5 year old Samsung tv. This makes the tv useless to me. The dealer is coming to collect it later today but they are CHARGING me for collection. Samsung Denmark don't give a flying f#ck about the situation."
"If I can give it zero stars I would. Their customer service is a joke. Extremely inefficient. Horrible communication skills and lack of understanding and excecution. I will never purchase anything from Samsung again. They have officially lost my business."
"I am completely disappointed in your product right now and your customer service department. My phone started to catch fire in the middle of the night and i caught it. It was smoking. I am being told the only way to help is to send my phone and have it fixed. While i will now have a phone to have contact with my children or husband. I am fully prepared to go to my lawyer tomorrow because no one want to help me. I have a s10+"
"Absolutely disgusted by Samsung's after care. Brought the Eco Bubble washing machine in 2017, 3 years on the concrete base has broken, not usual wear and tear, it is a poorly built machine that broke 3 years into use. This particular machine came with a 5 year warranty however, I registered the warranty through the post, this instantly invalidated the 5 year warranty apparently and I only got the 2 years manufacturer warranty, as somewhere in the small print it states the warranty must be registered online only. Machine out of warranty, I went ahead and contacted an engineer to come out to look at the machine who informed us this should not have broken this soon into its life, he tried to order parts but low and behold they may only be purchased from Samsung approved engineers, at this point with much going backwards and forwards no washing machine for 3 weeks and numerous trips and expense to the launderette, I was promised a call from the head office which I never received. Out of pure frustration I agreed to have a call out from their engineer £70+Vat call out charge,  plus cant tell me if my repairs will be a further £40+Vat or £130+Vat without looking at it, so I went ahead and booked the call out charge with their 3rd party approved repairer, waited a week for them to turn up and they did not show claiming that they have been trying to call me all day when I had not received a single call. I do not think it s morally right to force people to use expensive repairers without a choice who do not even turn up and then to be told by Samsung again after 4 weeks of not having a washing machine there is nothing they can do but escalate it further to which they do not. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ANYHTING FROM SAMSUNG."
"If I could give this zero stars that's what they would get, I bought a brand new 4K 55-in Samsung TV in November 2018 the first one failed within a week and was quickly replaced by Argos under warranty, now this one has failed 18 months later, both screen related even though this fault is different to the original fault, and I have been told by Samsung that it is out of warranty, but for your information the Sales of Goods Act states that it should work for 6 years.. so this is being taken further with trading standards.Also I have had 2 smartphones and a soundbar fail in the last 4 years, I will never purchase another Samsung product again.."
"Been trying for over a month to get my refund and collection of faulted fridge freezer - no return call as promised to my numerous and frustrating attempts to contact them! While they sit on my money I have a fridge freezer blocking my kitchen! Covid is their lame excuse while comparable companies are managing well - absolutely disgraceful customer service! Do NOT buy white goods from this company if you want to keep your sanity!!"
"Samsung washing machine broke down after 4 months  .The after sales is SHOCKING . They sent technician out three time to the same fault which was still not fixed . I asked for a refund or replacement machine NO JOY . Please DONT BUY A SAMSUNG WASHING MACHINE unless you want to have loads of hassle and have DISGUSTING customer service I contacted A O . com who I purchased the machine from and the machine was changed within 24hrs needles to say not a SAMSUNG"
"I'm using samsung electronics for a long time. They are good no doubt I'm giving 4 stars because after 2 years they start getting problems in it that has to be fixed. They are still working but i repaired like twice. Overall good products Thanks for having this product"
"I've been using samsung electronics since then and it never failed me. I love this brand"

"Poor customer service, went to replace my earphone which was under warranty. They refused stating that due to some mobile software issue we cannot replace it and asked me to format my phone. I mean what my phone software has got to do with earphone. Pathetic serivce"
"Spent hours on the phone over a seven day period attempting to schedule a warranty repair. After actually getting to speak with someone I was advised a repair company would call to set up appt time. On the eighth day I got a text msg saying the event was canceled due to not returning the call. Be aware of buying Samsung products. My advice is to stay away."
"So spent £875 on a 55"" TV 3.5yrs ago and now i have white dots all over my screen. After buying extra 2yrs extended warranty i have been told that it will cost £59 to look at it then approx £400  to repair. Awful service, no offer to help with costs etc. I definately wont be buying Samsung again."
"it's fine except of it's heating behaviour.."
"The best brands in asia 2020-Samsung.Even it's affiliate advertisement corporation-Cheil Worldwide done a great job in promotion."
"Terrible experience with Samsung. Previously, I had to get a refund not for one, but for two vacuums with design problems. Refund process was very stressful and not consumer friendly.Now, as other many thousands US consumers who were unlucky to buy Samsung French door refrigerators, I’m fighting the company because of the design defect in the ice makers.  I have to re think my buying patterns and switch to the company that appreciates and values it’s customers."
"If I could rate the customer service of Samsung lower than 1 I would. I bought a $300 TV less than a year ago and have spent the last 2 months trying to get a refund. Approximately 15 calls placed, they can't find the issue, you get disconnected, they don't call you back, don't respond to emails they send... I will never buy another Samsung product."
"I ordered samsung galaxy s20 a few days ago from the companys website. I got a great deal on the website and got a discount from my student email also. Completely satisfied with the delivery and I also earned points for buying from samsung. I got the best price from their website. Later, I ordered a samsung smart watch active 2 from there also when they had a promotion. With the promotion and the student discount, i got the best deal from them. Enjoying both my items. Thank you samsung!"
"Extremely poor customer service. If you send in your issue to the ""contact"" on the website (same page as whatever you are dealing with), you receive an email back saying you are contacting the wrong department and must send to another department. It is a VERY FRUSTRATING continuous cycle of no one can help with your issue."
"galaxy bud+ got a set off buds+ around 3 months ago.. had a fault, been 'repaired' twice so far with no improvement.. returned last time and don't work at all.. samsung suggest sending them back again... dont have any faith in the process at all...trying to start a complaint procedure with samsung.. proving impossible so far.. will persist.. terrible customer service process"
"I bought a Samsung 58 inch TV online from Curries and in the paper work it tells you to register for the warranty.I tried this by live chat and they did everything in their power not to register the item.If the item breaks down their will be no record of my warranty so 600 pounds down the drain"
"Broken upon arrival. No return accepted.I will leave out some details but will answer any questions if anyone has any. I purchased this TV in December of 2019 when it was on special directly from Samsung. TV arrived with the front screen cracked. Called shipping company and told that they were not responsible, told me to contact Samsung direct. Contacted Samsung and was shotgunned around various departments for several weeks. Finally got a representative on the phone that said she could handle the claim. Emailed her these pictures below showing that someone had damaged the box in transportation and cracked the screen. She told me upper management had agreed with me and was going to be issuing a credit and to expect a call from upper management within 48 hours. After 3 days I called back and was told that upper management had decided not to honor my claim after all. I spoke with a manager and they told me the same thing. I know have a $1,500 that I have never plugged in or turned on since the screen is complete junk. The screen replacement part itself is over $1,100 not including labor to install and would obviously not longer have a manufacturer warranty. There is a design flaw with their screens and they are very fragile. Look online and see the tens of thousands of people making the same claim as me. All of them have had similar interactions as me which is very sad. I own another Samsung TV, a Samsung Phone, and a Samsung smart watch. Probably the last Samsung items I ever buy.

"my Samsung s9 phone had a fault with screen burn so contacted Samsung and a lovely girl spoke over the Internet who was working from home..we spoke for ages and went through everything and said I would have to contact UK.TECHNICAL@SAMSUNG with a receipt for the phone with her chat reference number. So I have done this and just keep getting a reply back that they cannot see the attachment on the e-mail so I have gone back and its clearly there.  Not helpful at all and poor for such a big company..i am going to complain to higher management. Plus my phone is out of its 2 year guarantee soon and maybe they know that to.. I will be looking at a different supplier if its not sorted soon, a shame this is my 2nd samsung phone.Andy saxbyI just wanted to update this review...it was difficult getting in touch with Samsung and it wasn't really clear how to send the information they required, but it all worked out in the end, they fixed my phone for free even the warranty had run out by a week but I think they knew covid 19 had paused everything. But they did come good in the end l. So thank you samsung team."
"I bought a 2019 16"" Q70R 65"" TV from Best Buy.  For nearly $1000 this TV screen has so much glare we can only watch it in a dark room.  If even one lamp is on, it appears in the middle of the screen like looking in a mirror.  I called Samsung and all they could say was that I should have bought the higher end Q80 for several hundred more dollars.  This TV is trash and they knew it when they put it in the box.  There is NO WHERE that this TV can be used without glare being a problem.  It should have never been on the market.  I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied.  At the very least, they should replace it with the one that does not have glare even if they charge for the difference.  They will not."
"I bought an 80R 55"" 2019, and after 6 months it started having problems, with the wifi connection and also bluetooth and remote control. Finally samsung services have to replace several boards from the TV, opening it completely. Still looking if the problems are solved, but the general impresion is why a brand new TV, that cost near 2000 usd is having this problems in less than a year. For the first time after several years, I really don't know if my next tv is going to be samsung, and that's sad. BR, Carlos"
"The products are there good, but the support is not at the highest level, so please know that, if so,etching is broken"
"I bought a OLED tv from curry’s, it had a fault which we reported in January. No response from Samsung customer care😳 rang several times booked call backs logged on the system still no response. We have had one technical on live chat, did a reset, and it’s got progressively worse! Been back to curry’s ......not interested told me it’s Samsung’s problem didn’t even log my complaint!😩. Between them it appears they have a system/agreement not to care for their customers! Still trying to resolve , watch social media for updates as I escalate this issue."
"Good company. I am using TV from the company thats great, although tablet got be a bit disappointing, working pretty slow and freezes a lot"
"I will never buy another Samsung product again. I bought a washer and dryer online from Lowe's. They were delivered in a reasonable amount of time and Lowe's did a great job. 2 days after getting them, the washing machine had a locking mechanism failure. That was on the 6th of June. It is currently the 29th of June. Me and my wife have called Samsung at least three times a week trying to get this resolved. I'm on my 6th trouble ticket still waiting for review still waiting to get a replacement unit because no service tech would come out and fix the lock, which by the way is a $60 part, because of the covid-19 pandemic. If I fix the lock myself in voids the warranty that I bought. The Lowe's doesn't have a problem delivering a washer and dryer but a technician can't come into my home and spend one hour fixing a lock mechanism in a separate room. I have been fighting with customer service this entire time they have finally agreed to give me a replacement unit but that is under review for another 5 days. In my experience they haven't followed through at all with their own time frames that they give their own people. I will never buy a product from Samsung again. I have Samsung phones TVs fridge and now this washer and dryer, Blu-ray players you name it. There is other brands out there that are equally good equipment."
"My phone cant hold alot of data before it drags the whole thing down. It's like it has a mind of its own. It's so slow and I lose connection all the time."
"when you buy from the online Samsung shop, you never know what the colour of your product will be until it arrives. This is because the detail of colour is absent from your receipt, order confirmation, shipping details and progress emails, until the box actually arrives you don't know whether your order is as you proposed.Having received a colour you know you didn't order if you want the correct item you must buy it again and return the wrong one for refund. I will let you know how that turns out!"
"Samsung customer service in UAE is so bad. They do not help the customers at all if there is an issue in there device, i would not recommend there device to anyone. They have hired employees who would rather ask you to shut up than help you. I went 4 times with my sister note 9 within warranty they refused to help and now i purchased my buds for AED 500 almost they refused to help saying we updated the software.It's better to buy some other device rather than SAMSUNG, because all the want is to make money not satisfy the customer. we have been loyal to Samsung since the start but it time we changed and made are friends and family change too. The employees are also not good at all.I again called the customer service no one is ready to help. The device isn't connecting to the phone and they are saying they are perfectly fine."
"I have been loyal Samsung customer since 2004 back during flip phones. I never really had an issue with them, I bought with my refund check a $300 phone, the Samsung a50, which if it had a basic form of Android it would be a good thing. It comes with so much Samsung bloatware they ruined absolutely ruined a good product. when I first got it you could change the permissions on most of their apps and disabled most of them except for Samsung pass which if you disabled that it wouldn't let you on any of their other apps for some reason, Samsung pass controls all of their apps. I didn't like them collecting my info I already had Google to do that, my passwords and such.so I called Samsung try to explain the situation that look I don't want you to doing thisexcetera excetera can you please remove this from my phone so it's not staying on and using memory and battery. They refuse I absolutely flat-out refuse to remove one single app, 1.so I tried to delete all their stuff and it wasn't going well it cause the phone to spaz the f out. Now to this date I spent a total of 10 hours half a day basically on the phone Samsung trying to get them to help me with this and to do something and I've gotten absolutely no hair no help and just attitude after attitude and bad experience a customer care that i have ever experienced, and in the middle of all this day updated all of their apps as to where you can't even turn the permissions off anymore, one things that you do not need them to collect if you read their agreement and their statement at the beginning of the fan when you first turn it on for the very first time it tells you what they're trying to build a model of a program and they are using this it's basically a model of the human psyche to tell you what you want before you want it. And they flat out tell you this, it is not a crazy conspiracy theory they tell you this if you read it why they want to collect your info. I really don't care what they collect of mine but when I buy your product and I knew clean to want me to have a phone that fits my needs my personal needs but I cannot customize it to where I needed to be your just being greedy. well I got to the point where my phone base it was not working because I deleted my account with them with Samsung and I disable as much as I could with the apps and so it stopped working completely so I call up Samsung ask for a refund on a phone that's less than 6 months old that's covered by their manufacturer's warranty, and they will not under the manufacturer's warranty. They tell me to call straight talk or Walmart, I call straight talk and they tell me I have to go to Samsung so I basically wasted $300 on the phone that is absolutely useless to me and it seems like any other thing you buy whatever company whatever Network you choose just fill it up with so much bloatware that it's impossible to use. I like some Google apps I like some a Samsung apps I like some of Microsoft apps are like some of individual developers apps. why do these companies not let you have access to your phone your phone that you buy and you pay for it to make it how you want it whilel at the same timeclaiming that they care about you as a customer and once you to have a phone that you can personalize to your needs when you can it's impossible to do when you can't even remove these apps I don't need three f****** voice assistants that they have on this app that I can't use all of them at once and because they're all unable to be to even disabled nowthey fight each other for the permissions to access this exact same files to make it run, making your phone slow bog down wasting the battery, making the phone service quality horrible I can't even hear people in my phone anymore I never could, I have six in the same each apps that I don't need just different companies that had their hand in the process of making it and Samsung is letting it happen and they actually are making it even worse because they want your data."
"Having 3 wireless speakers and using the multiroom app to access Deezer we had a message saying no internet when it was working fine. Uninstalled the app and then loaded it again only to find we then cannot sign in to Deezer it says invalid username and password. YestEre cam connect to the tv and listen to tune in with no problem in the app. Yet we can sign in direct to Deezer☹. 3 phone calls to Samsung the first to try to get us to link the speakers to the tv, this we can do ok.They really didn't grasp that the problem was only signing in to Deezer on the app. I  the 3rd call I got someone who understood what I was saying and came back saying it was believed to be an issue with an upgrade that had been done and had caused a fault. So much for upgrades improving things. Why the first two people didn't get this is a mystery, they spoke good English."
"I call in about having an issue with my new 32 inch monitor. After waiting hours I finally got a tech. The tech told me to ship the monitor to a 3rd party company for repair. They told me to ship everything, just in case the monitor needed to be replaced. When the monitor was returned. The stand was missing. You can't use a monitor with a stand. I called Samsung support who told me they would ship out a replacement stand immediately. Two week later, no replacement stand. I called Samsung to find out what was going on and they told me the information they had about my monitor was wrong and needed more information. Ummm? Why didn't they call me if they need more information? Who is running the customer service organization? I was told I would get a text message when I provided a picture of the back of the monitor with the serial number and model. Nothing. No text no emails. I call Samsung back and was disconnected twice and the phone system that is suppose to call you back while waiting in queue had issues and also dropped me twice. When I got a tech, she put me on hold while trying to get a supervisor on the phone after an hour of waiting on the phone with her, she told me she would call me back... No return call yet.  Obviously Samsung has little concern for their customers. Very little effort is put into making sure the phone techs are trained or have the necessary tools to do the job well. It is also obvious there is little management oversight over the phone support staff. You wait hours to get someone on the phone and if the problem is too difficult, they just hang up on you. The 3rd party company Samsung uses to fix equipment is giving Samsung a bad name. Get some leadership to manage you customer service department. It's not hard, just find people who care."
"..trying to convince myself to ever buy a Samsung product ever again after their robotic, ""No, this is the only option!"" Customer Service template. Sent in a trade-in for a rebate on a new S20 Plus phone only to be emailed back saying it wouldn't be accepted due to not being reset to their standards, despite having confirmation I did the reset properly from other support agents. ""Nope, we can't reset the phone ourselves even with your permission that's not our policy."" In the end, I won't receive a $300 rebate, ill have my purposeless old phone back, and I'll continue to watch reviews of their competition's tech on my new LG OLED C9."
"Bought a galaxy s20 ultra and on about a month the charging port stopped workingWas told by Samsung the part would take 2 months to get to me or I could send the phone to them and after they'd completed the repair (which would take 2+ weeks they'd send it back) all the while i would have no phone because they do not offer loaner phonesSpent 1400$ on a phone and they told me there was no way for me to not be phoneless besides buying another phone while they fixed the issue thats under warranty"
"Customer service is horrible.  I've worked with them for over 3 months and many phone calls to exchange a product under warranty. They asked me to send the item in for review and they responded that the product was going to be replaced under warranty. That was 3 1/2 months ago.   I waited and waited for the replacement item and nothing every came.  I called again after 2 months and they blamed the delay on the Covid crisis.  Fair enough, I'll wait longer.  After another month of non response I get an email from them saying that I was supposed to have the defective product in my possession, which I did not since they asked me to send in to them in March.  I called again and they said that was a mistake.   Waited another 10 days and called them again and this time they said they no longer had any of the product in their warehouses and could only only return my money.   That was no good since I purchased the product in March at discount and could no longer get that price.  I told them i wanted an exchange and they said they could not provide an exchange.  Then they sent me a text asking for my approval to send me a refund.  By this time I was totally frustrated and told them I would take the money and never buy Samsung again.   I recieved another email form to fill out to get the refund, but when I submitted it their server didnt work.  I finally gave up and decided that I had spent WAY too much time on this exchange considering the small refund I was getting.  They called today and asked why I hadnt sent in the refund approval and I told them I tried and gave up when their server wasnt working.  I told them to keep my money and that trying to get warranty service from them wasnt worth the time I was putting into it.   They decided to refund my money anyway without my submitting a form, but I'm not holding my breath that I'll ever see that refund check.   During this entire ordeal I've found that the front line support technicians have been very nice and try to help, but don't appear to have the support of their backend techs nor their management.   During one of my calls I was subjected to a chewing out of a front line tech by a backend tech asking why he was being bothered with my call.  I was amazed that all of this was going on in my presence and to me indicates a serious problem with management and attitude.  Very rigid and hierarchical culture apparently and more concerned about rules and process and not as concerned about the customer as they should be.  I have been a long time Samsung fan and always purchased Samsung in the past, but from now on my eyes have been opened and I will be looking long and hard at other sources and their track records.  I'll avoid Samsung whenever I can."
"Horrible Support, if you have bought a Samsung Product and it has broken you may as well bin it as Samsung doesn't fix them even if you are in warranty!"
"I went with out an appointment and was impressed wthe the following:Staff very friendly and clean,Nice moderate shop,Prices are very reasonable,Fixing time of a cell phone really quick,Other options like the pick up service or making an appointment same same excellent,Overall I would say a 9.8 grade for this service shop"
"I have a 65in 4KUltra curved tv.Suddenly developed white spots in a grid pattern. This problem has been reported for some time and apparently Samsung does not repair or adjust their manufacturing to avoid the problem. Buy something cheap so that it does not hurt to send to electronic recycling"
"Absolutely horrific the way this company treats its customers and Jerks them around over two weeks with no refrigerator??? Not to mention their service department staff are absolute bubbleheads!! I’ve spent seriously at least over 8 hours total on the the phone with Samsung either on hold or telling yet another representative the same story over and over again!!! Also was hung up on twice!! This piece of Crap French door stainless refrigerator we bought from them that just stopped cooling after a year!! And now they won’t do anything to repair it or fix it. No reputable appliance place wants to handle their service because their replacement parts are so hard to get??? After two weeks of being given the run around they said they can’t do anything for us !!! REALLY??? It’s out of warranty!! PLEASE !!! Don’t purchase anything From Samsung They SUCK BIG TIME !!!!"
"I'm a plumber installing a Samsung dishwasher for my customer that she bought for her home renovation. Well the kick plate didn't come with it. Her home was getting renovated so the Dishwasher sat in her hallway for a month. When I opened the box, there was no kick plate. Called Samsung and they refused to send me one, even with a receipt showing purchase. So now she has to spend $40 on a kick plate because Samsung screwed up. I even talked to a supervisor and they still refused to send me one. I will/she will never buy anything from you guys again. I know a lot of people & will share this experience with them. Absolutely ridiculous & unfair that she has to spend another $40 on top of the $400 she spent for the dishwasher. Absolutely ridiculous! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
"Pure bs. I got a Samsung tv from costco and it is garbage! The remote is slow and laggy. When I first got it, I had to wait before going into any smarthub app. I don’t have that problem anymore but it is still glitchy and vague."
"I was excited to Purchase a tv from them when it was on sale and realized that the shipping addressed was wrong as they had omitted my apartment number. Contacted Samsung right away and they said they would contact Fedex. After three days I contacted fedex myself and they said no one has contacted them from Samsung. Called back Samsung who assured me they had called to make the change. I asked for confirmation of this so I could contact fedex with this new information and they hung up on me. Called again and asked to speak to a manager who informed me that upon further review nothing had been done to contact fedex but he would do so right away. He then suggested to cancel the order and reorder the tv again. Did that and notice that the tv was no longer on sale. Samsung would not honor the price even tho they omitted my apartment number in the first place. Waste of my time with no resolution. Their customer service is trash!!!"
"Used the trade-in. Factory reset my working phone and sent it in. Got an e-mail today saying that my phone was not reset and that the screen did not work. Now they are going to return a phone they might have broken (or it was broken in the mail) and not pay me my trade-in. What a swindle."
"Bought a 50"" tv of their's from Walmart. 1st the sound cut out. They sent a tech with a flash drive to correct the issue under warranty. Worked for a month then the picture started going blank, over the phone they told me to reset the tv. After that we have to unplug the tv for it to even turn on and guess what? Now the original sound issue is back on top of the other 2 issues. They never fixed it the 1st time and had to argue with them numerous times to get them to do something. The 3rd party company they want to send says it's a minimum $200 just to take a look. Called Samsung yet again and was told a supervisor would call back in an hr. 5 days later WE called THEM again and finally got a supervisor named Carla who set a warranty appointment up with Service Click. She mentioned a 90 day warranty (from the original call that didn't resolve the issue). Just got a text from Service Click saying once again they are charging at least $200 to come out. So now I have to call Samsung and rip them again. My roommate purchased the same tv at the same time and hasn't had any issues. I got a lemon and they need to either refund my money or give me a brand new tv, not that refurbished crap"
"My new washing machine works very well! Great job Samsung!"
"The positive about Samsung is looking good but the quality is suck. Don't ever buy Samsung Appliance. WON'T LAST LONG"
"At this point if I could leave 0 stars I would.  I purchased a Samsung Active watch about 8 months ago.  It was my second Samsung fitness watch.  My first one just up and quit working.  I figured it probably needed a new battery (it was only 2 years old) but you can't change it yourself so I decided I might as well get a newer model.  So... I purchased my Active.  I was pretty pleased with it but one day the back of the watch where the sensors are just fell off while it was on my arm.  I looked down and it had just come off and was laying partially under the watch on my arm (unbroken glass but no longer attached to the watch).  I sent it in to Samsung and they didn't want to repair it under warranty because I ""broke"" the glass back.  It was NOT broken it just fell off.  It was attached only by something resembling double sided tape that had come undone.  After arguing with them I finally got them to cover the repair with the warranty.... Fast forward four months.  I went snorkeling in one of our beautiful Florida springs.  I was only in the water for :15 or :20 minutes and  the top of my snorkel never went under the surface of the water so I was NEVER beyond 5 feet.  Now... keep in mind their ads show a video of a guy diving into a pool and swimming with his Samsung fitness watch... Their Q & A page shows answers to questions about whether it can be used swimming, as basically, yes as long as you are less than 5' deep and for less than :30 minutes.  Well... my watch broke that day swimming in the spring and I sent it back to Samsung again.  They now refuse to cover it under warranty because it has water damage!!! They wanted me to pay almost as much to fix it as I paid for the watch.   Really???  Talk about false advertising.  Shame on you Samsung.  It seems you claim anything that is wrong with the watch is not covered by the warranty because of something the buyer has done wrong. I have been a loyal customer for years using many of your products... some better than others but I am done now.  You have lost me as a customer over this.  I know you don't care... you showed me that while I tried to deal with this for over an hour today on the phone.  Shame on you!"
"my screen broke and i cant even repair it. their screen is so expensive. now i want to buy iphone 8 rather"
"Excellent service, not overly pushy sales staff and very helpful. Went in with my phone that was very quiet on calls and they cleaned it out free of charge while I waited. Ended up purchasing a new phone for my girlfriend and the process was quick and easy."
"I needed a new phone and have been contemplating what phone I wanted to buy for the last 24 hours! I was split between the Iphone 11 Pro Max and the S20 Ultra, so decided to use the live chat service. What Jheanie did not know was that I was doing the same thing with Apple and I was speaking to one of their advisors at the same time! Being a life-long iPhone user, it should have been an easy sell for the apple advisor however Jheanie's courteous tone, helpful manner, and pure patience is what won me over! He is a credit to the company and I felt reassured that if I ever needed to speak to Samsung it would be a similar experience. Thank you Jheanie and Samsung, can't wait for the phone to arrive tomorrow! :D"
"Reading the Trustpilot reviews made by people with a similar experiences to me has made me realise that Samsung may have a massive name and huge turnover but the products seem to be generally low quality and cheaply made.Would you step aboard and fly on an aircraft if you knew that all of the individual components had been supplied as the lowest cost option? Then why buy junk from this outfit?"
"samsung is good"
"We have paid over £1000 for our Samsung fridge freezer and 6months after purchase the paint around the drinks dispenser started to bubble we reported this to Samsung via email along with photos of the damage all we get back from them is an email back acknowledging that they have received the email this has know been going on for 2 years the fridge has now gone rusty and unsightly, but despite several emails to them still no response we have also rang there customer service team to complain and had the phone put down on me .they have the worst customer service I have ever known and will never buy another Samsung product again"
"Samsung user since 2013 – no let-downs so far! I've been using the Galaxy Note10+ since November 2019, and it's been working perfectly!I had the Gear IconX (2018), Galaxy Buds, and now I'm using the Buds+. With the Buds+, they have finally fixed every issue they had with previous products, and boy! They've made the best wireless earbuds in the world, hands down!"
"I am not impressed with Samsung at all. After owning an A40 for 2 months, the screen stopped working. When I brought it into a Samsung repair centre, they claimed it had water damage even though I've never had it anywhere near water. I've had many phones before that, all that seemed to last more than two months. If a phone can get water ingress from normal usage in two months, there's clearly something wrong with the build of the phone."
"Got 2 Samsung TV's at home and so happy with them! Great colors and very user friendly menu! Highly recommend them!"
"Purchased Galaxy Buds, One broke after 2 weeks and was advised to take it into a store. They don't have a single store open in my state that I can take it to at the moment. So now I have to send it off for repairs. This means after owning a product for two weeks (which took a month to come) I'll now have to lose it for another few weeks. Honestly appalled and this has been a reoccurring theme with Samsung"
"I had to pick a star. But this company is not worthy of that either. I spent over thousands of dollars with Samsung. Just to be put on hold for hours. Then all of a sudden the call mysteriously drops.They make you download their new update right when the new models are out. And right after then you will notice stuff starting to go wrong with your phone. I wonder why lol? Common people open your eyes or be doomed."
"Samsung is the worst company I have ever worked with. Their customer service is terrible. I usually don't bother writing reviews, and I am usually not one to complain, but Samsung is so terrible that I thought I should warn others against using them. I got a Galaxy A10E (a terrible, terrible phone) through them and it has not worked since I got it. It does not receive text messages, a basic function that should work. I have sent my phone in four times, but each time they have just sent me back my original phone with no fixes, even though they have told me multiple times that they would send me a replacement/my money back. Those in customer service are very poorly trained and depending on the person I have talk to, downright rude. DO NOT USE SAMSUNG!!!!"
"Awful service placed an order on Friday for “next day delivery” called yesterday to see where it was up to and was advised they will send me an update email, received an update email confirming I will receive my item today (Tuesday) after checking all day for the delivery info I called up to be told it now won’t be until tomorrow (Wednesday) and to disregard the email confirmation I had previously received also that they didn’t know why there was an issue. if you want one of their products I’d advise going 3rd party as going direct is terrible."
"All electronics at my home are either Samsung or Sony, they are the best. Also great customer support. Brilliant stuff!"
"Both a TV today, so far so good the color is amazing heard a lot of good stuff from friends and family so we bought one today. I will post something here for sure if it has some detectives. I spoke to their agents and they're able to offer some clarification with the warranty just in case. The delivery is fast as well."
"I wish I had gone to this site before I purchased Samsung kitchen appliances. The service gets 1 star only because of the heroic efforts of an empathetic support person. The support systems however are dysfunctional. Apparently communication links from email, text, and voice are not articulated with the website portal to “my products.”"
"I have only had samsung electronics my whole life and I would never change it."
"ordered a Samsung Tab s5e from there web site Monday 20/04/2020, today is the 24/04/2020 with no tablet in sight, only after getting on the phone to them which was very hard as the person I spoke to could hardly speak English was I told there will be a 4 week delay on my order due to covid 19 and lack of stock? I mean really why sell items you do not have and take people's money. Jokers never again will I order from Samsung."
"Their customer service is insanely horrible, I am searching for another brand that's comparable because I refuse to give Samsung another penny.   I'm stuck with a $1,000 phone that they broke during repair for their manufacturing issues and they have no loaner plan. I run my charity off of phone and cannot be without a phone.  Animals died because I couldn't get calls the last time they kept it for 15 days.  Now they want me to pay for repairs when they damaged it."
"I really enjoy Samsung company, they provide amazing products at good prices. I hope they stay up for at least a decade or more!"
"I purchased a 65 inch Samsung T.V. several months ago. When putting it out, everything was included in the packaging except the 4 Screws that hold the T.V. stand. I called Samsung customer service the next day and got a total runaround. after speaking to 4 different people, the fourth person said he would mail out the screws. Months went by and no screws. Today I get an email fromGwendolyn Samsung Triage, Customer Service Dept. telling me that in order to get the screws I must email her a picture of my receipt. I have purchased 5 Samsung T.V.'S over the past 12 years and this person wants proof of my purchase for 4 screws. first off I registered it online the day that I bought it, that's enough proof. I will NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. What a horrible experience and a waste of time talking to all these people over the phone. Stay away from Samsung, because if you need customer service you WILL NEVER GET IT."
"I want to be clear. A defective device is understandable; these things happen. Samsung's response, the lack of an expedited replacement policy, the lack of a customer retention department to handle complaints, the lack of assistance for returning the defective equipment without having to go in to a FedEx facility in a time of a serious epidemic is not.The following is my post on Samsung's community forum. This was the only option for lodging a complaint provided me by Samsung customer service.I ordered a Galaxy Chromebook April 6, the first day it was available. This was a gift for my sister, who has been waiting for a new computer for months.It arrived April 13 and she opened the gift yesterday, April 14. She was so excited.We charged it. It didn't turn on. I fiddled with it for a bit and got it on and she started the set up. The laptop was on for a few minutes then turned off. I fiddled with it a bit more and it turned on for a few seconds, but then turned off. It acted like there was a short.I spoke with customer service. After technical support determined there was indeed something wrong with the thing, I was transferred to someone else. Samsung's solution to this was a return label and return via FedEx.My sister and I are both elderly and at high risk for severe complications from the novel coronavirus. We have not been inside a store in many weeks. Hope FedEx picks up at the door. I'll find out when they open. Customer service had no advice on this issue.I was told Samsung has no replacement policy, that to get a new Chromebook I will just need to order a new one. The first shipping date available is May 6. We will need to wait nearly a month for a new computer.I will have to pay for the new Chromebook before I get my refund for the defective one. Customer service offered me a $25 discount on the new laptop.[UPDATE: I have ordered a new laptop from Best Buy, which fortunately has curbside pick up. I will not be able to use the $25 discount code so generously provided by Samsung, but we will get the computer today.]I asked to speak to a customer retention representative, i.e. the complaint department. Samsung doesn't have such a department.This is the first Samsung product I have ever ordered. It may well be the last."
"I havent gotten help with my samsung 7 yet. That works"
"My Samsung EHS61ASFWE Earphones have damaged my iPhone and my iPad. When I use them a video or song starts and stops at random, maybe once every 10 seconds. It also makes a video play x10 faster. Or when I play music on Spotify it makes several random songs play simultaneously. It has caused permanent damage to my iPad, the keyboard no longer works. These cheap earphones cause expensive damage! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Poor customer service.Will never receive the promotion what the Samsung mentioned on the web."
"Wonderful S20 ultra!I am so pleased with this product. I just replaced s9 and think the world of this ultra. It is the best phone on the planet!I will still be getting the Fold cuz i love the concept of that phone too. I want something like they have on the HBO show West world. So the Fold is something that i find to be the closet thing. There is a possibility that this ultra changes my mind, cuz it is so awesome!"
"Samsung is a terrible company. I bought a high end washing machine, which has broken twice already- the first time I spent weeks on the phone trying to get an engineer/still under warranty/- ended up calling Samsung UK, who eventually managed to get a local, I suspect , outsourced, technician to come- three visits, third visit the problem fixed.Now, after a few months I have another issue with the machine, and having been unable to wash my clothes as an NHS staff, makes me frustrated and dissatisfied with the Samsung’s customer care- basically they are closed, no way you can contact anybody and arrange a safe non-contact repair of the machine.AVOID , DO NOT BUY ANYTHING SAMSUNG unless cheap stuff you could simply throw away. Horrible horrible company- I will never buy anything from Samsung again.UPDATE- the machine is still not working, so as an NHS doctor treating COVID patients I am unable to wash my clothes!!! Tried to contact Samsung through chat with an adviser, who asked a few senseless questions to buy the time, as probably was serving a few customers at the same time, and after I typed all relevant info with a type of machine, serial numbers, etc- the connection was deemed too long and was ended- it is a shambolic customer service. Again DO NOT BUY ANYTHING SAMSUNG!LATEST UPDATE.I managed to contact Samsung UK and also Samsung FB- they refused to cover the costs of repair, MOREOVER they cancelled my extended warranty for non-authorised repair- what a perverse action from Samsung.Again, the NHS effort to fight the virus was praised on many levels, yet companies like Samsung are the least supportive, defenitely do not stand to the task when comes to their responsibilities-they saved some petty money on my machine though😂😂😂! Feel sorry for them tbh, so horrible feedback from the customers."
"Samsung are terrible! I bought a $1500 tv 2 years ago and the whole screens gone black,like all the lights have blown,terrible customer service with no help at all,you even have to pay to talk to someone,very dissatisfied,I’ll never buy anything Samsung again!!"
"S20 is the greatest phone on the market right now but also price isn't good."
"I’ve had cell phones in the past. As of about 5-6 years ago I stopped buying and switched to Apple and LG products. CELL PHONES- they purposely make it so the battery will die quicker over some amount of time and the charger port is made to poorly break causing charging issues. They are overpriced like any other phone but for what you get, it should last longer than 1.5-2 years. Especially when it is well taken care of. Pop ups on androids never end. Somehow my apple doesn’t do that. I do not recommend a Samsung phone unless it’s a cheaper prepaid. Those actually seem to last a big longer. I will never buy the phones again. DISHWASHER- Poorly made and designed. The outside was nice but the inside just SUCKED. Difficulty assorting dishes and cups as the prongs weren’t set in a way where it’s easy to clean the dishes. It was a good dishwasher. I only had that one as it was a gift to me. If you prefer Samsung products, the dishwasher isn’t terrible. TV’s- It’s hit and miss with the TVs. I have 3 Samsung TVs. All but 1 has had an issue. I had to pay for it to be fixed out of MY pocket. Although it was a glitch on Samsung’s end. They refused to assist unless I PAID FOR A TECH TO COME LOOK AT THE TV! That’s absolute horseshi*! What would happen was the TV screen would go black after 10 mins  and I could only hear what was on the TV. Or the screen would flicker and then boot me off. So I guess if you want their TV, don’t get it when it FIRST comes out. Sit back and watch the reviews. It’s not better than some other TVs and brands out there. The picture quality is still nice with the one I currently have. CUSTOMER SERVICE- THEYRE TERRIBLE AND ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY!!!! As stated above I had a TV issue, I called Samsung. They said they can send techs out to LOOK at the TV. If they can’t fix it or find the cause I still have to pay for a Samsung tech to come look at it. Asinine. They could not and would not work with me or help me whatsoever unless I paid for it. No matter who I talked to and their ranking, it was only about money. They do not give a crock about their customers. If something goes wrong, Samsung holds no accountability. Even if it’s recalled. Customer service isn’t even worth a star. They’re absolute garbage and useless at that. Samsung will refuse to take blame for any problems. Overall- I do no recommend their cell phones. It’s buyers choice of appliances and TVs. I Only speak from experience. Other Samsung electronics besides above named are up to the buyer to decide. I’ll be sticking to LG and Apple or Other products from now on."
"Never buy a Samsung Galaxy A8. After about 12 months it becomes increasingly difficult to charge. At 18 months it is almost impossible, and now at 21 months it takes about 15 minutes of fiddling to get the charger port to connect to the USB-C cable. Obvious planned obsolescence. With a 24 month contract there is pretty much no way you are making it through to the end. This is the last Samsung product I will ever own."
"They remove functionality that I was using in their updates. I hate this company so much for their trash products they offer and change and break.. Never buy Samsung again.. ever"
"Bought Samsung washing machine around 2 years ago. And recently jus mashine started vibrate really bad. Phone samsung, and they send technician to have look. Now they visit as 3 times replace doors. But mashine still bad as it was. Technician don't even bother to testing after work been carried. Even my neighbours can hear it going. Have put my 10 years old mashine in place as samsung not interested to fix it. Won't buy it again. Why pay twice more for for things not working properly. Very disappointed"
"I have a PC AND TV They are good for me, Samsung the best"
"Good product My TV and many other devices"
"I recently ordered a soundbar from Samsung online. I was sent an email stating it had shipped out via Fed Ex. Unfortunately, it never shipped. I called and live chatted with Samsung numerous times only to keep being told it was on it's way (even though it was not tracking). They made me wait 9 DAYS to file a claim saying it was lost. How was it lost if it NEVER left!? Finally after day 9, they said they would refund me. I stated I did not care about a refund, I just wanted my soundbar (I had used $345 in accrued Samsung points toward the $1200 purchase) otherwise I would have just ordered from somewhere else at this point. NOW I have to wait 3-5 days for the refund to post to my account before I can re-order. How about you just send me what I paid for and quit making me wait! Absolutely insane."
"Worst customer service I have ever experienced I have ever encountered. And just for a simple USB cord and fast charging unit. My issue is still not resolved. One star is to much."
"Without a doubt the worst Customer Service (Service should be changed to Run Around) I  have ever experienced. One month of holds, going over why I am calling over and over again. Promises of call backs that never happen and every conversation with a different person is a very frustrating. Just got off the phone for the last time. Product has been recalled and there is nothing they can or will do to fix or replace item. LAST PURCHASE FROM SAMSUNG!"
"Made an order online, did not receive a confirmation email within days, but had screenshot of order number from post purchase. Credit card even had an authorization. Contacted customer support, they couldn't find the order. However, I could even look up the order on their website via a lookup tool. I sent them screenshots of the lookup and the confirmation number. Days later they responded asking for 2 more business days to look into it. 5 business days later finally responded that they couldn't figure it out, and just asked me to order it again. It took 2.5 weeks, and there was no resolution other than a token ""so sorry"" for the inconvenience email. Worthless support."
"My son bought a VR headset in December 2019. The headset did not work so he sent it back to be repaired. It is now March and he has called several times (~8) and every person we talk to says it's another department and transfers us. At this point he just wants a refund but again, we keep being told that's another department and transferred. This is an extremely unethical company that will give you the run around until you give up and keep your money and merchandise. We will not ever be buying a Samsung product again."
"I have been a repeat customer. I purchased 2 refrigerators and a TV.The first refrigerator, I gave to a family member. Purchased a second on to replace it. They have both gone out, and Samsung has the worse customer service. Very disappointed with the whole experience.  Will not use or recommend them in the future. The TV does do not correctly either."
"Very bad customer service, company is located in Asia /more likely in India/, staff are not trained at all and were not able not only to help me, but even to locate my account whatever details I provided. Regret to open one - if I knew that this is a rubbish company based in Asia from the beginning - never would provide my details! Lairs - on their website there is a machine which I need, in reality it is not available.  Wasted my time enormously and did not help me at all! Avoid!!!!!"
"I purchased a soundbar 5.1/on 2-20-19 when i received it one of the speakers didn't work i contacted them about repairing it i sent the unit to them outta my pocket they received it discovered that it was not repairable and my option was to upgrade or receive a refund I chose refund that was May of 2019 is now February 2020 I've went through 1000 adjustments they agreed that they need to pay me but yet they still haven't not sent me my check I keep getting the runaround that they have to go through the departments before the check to be mailed out but already discovering that they owe me so if you purchase something from Samsung and you need to repair it you might as well just buy from a different company cuz Samsung only wants to take money and not be responsible if they owe u just frustrating and Despicable"
"We have  Samsung front load washing machine......due to some error it had some problem......we complained for almost 6 months continuously, however all in vain... infact the worse part was that many engineers visited and said they will bring the required parts or will take it to workshop...but none came backAfter continuous complaints one engineer came and took our the washing machine to workshop n returned back.....the experience with Samsung services is pathetic.....worst part is our washing machine's earlier error is still there n along with that it's making terrible noise while washing.....would never recommend anyone to buy Samsung due to it's terrible after sales service"
"A depressing & sressfull 4.5 hours in the Trafford Centre Samsung Shop....Due to a loud disco & DJ it was almost impossible to hear the technician, or him hear me. The volume of the music couldn't be turned down as they were ""launching a new product"" 🤣 But i succeeded! Approached the DJ . Explained the difficulty the technician & I were having hearing each other & she turned it down immediately.The S-Pen was stuck inside my new Galaxy phone. Could be removed, but would be damaged & not covered under guarantee. £30 extra to replace.Then  they  managed to lose all my WhatsApp messages for both my WhatsApp accounts."
"I am normally a great fan of John Lewis & Partners, but recent events have made me re-think that!There appears to be a large number of Samsung customers experiencing the same issue with their TVs as myself. That being, large purple patches developing on the screen which cannot be repaired, in some cases as soon as 2 years after purchasing. The only solution being to have the screen replaced at an unviable cost. Samsung are making no acknowledgement of the level of complaints about this issue, which, with the volume of posts on numerous noticeboards, can only be the result of a manufacturing or design issue.I also have this ‘Purple Patch’ issue with my 5 year old Samsung UE50H6400, purchased from John Lewis. So I am outside of their 5 year warranty, but still within the 6 year claim period of Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. I called John Lewis to discuss my intention to pursue a claim on this basis and they came back to me with the suggestion that if I paid the £105.00 call out charge for a Samsung engineer to confirm that my TV was “either inherently faulty or unrepairable”, then John Lewis would be able to settle my claim to the sum of £22.20. CHECKMATE!"
"I bought a Samsung Refrigerator and every six months ice starts coming through the back and it freezes up and doesn't stay cold and so this went on for four years and luckily I had bought the extra three year warranty but after it came up for renewal Geek Squad would not renew it because it is a total lemon and even the techs admitted that Samsung has not worked out the bugs yet.  So now I have this fancy french door fridge with all the bells and whistles but is a piece of junk that doesn't work and they won't even consider a pro-rated trade in or anything.  I am spreading the word never buy a Samsung Refrigerator, even they won't stand behind their Korean made junk."
"Bought their TV about two years ago. The TV screen has been flickering and acting up since last year but not often. As it is still within the warranty, I sent a video clip to show the customer service what the issue is. Returned my TV at the repair centre for further assessment and repair.Apparently they didn't find any issue. They claim it as no fault but cannot explain why the TV screen was flickering. Nothing was fixed, no repair was carried out. Receiving my FAULTY TV back. Completely waste of time. Ask the customer service what to do if this happened again or outside warranty. Their reply was to contact them again and see what they can do.DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A FAULT THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM NOR FIX IT!GOOD LUCK"
"The phone I purchased kept malfunctioning and after they attempted to repair it 5 times and it still didn't work properly, they refused to give me a refund or a functional replacement. Their customer service line makes customers wait on hold for hours."
"Samsung customer service is trash. My phone is not receiving over air updates and I've been going in circle with ATT and Samsung. One sends me to the other. Most recently the rep had me explain how I knew there was an update. Are you serious? It hasn't received an update since May 2018. Also if you ask a question, be prepared to have to ask it multiple times as this gentleman had a real hearing/listening issue. I then called ATT and spent 20 minutes talking about farming and the weather, all the while guy from ATT was working. At this point it looks like it didnt work but at the end of the day ATT was cool and spoke to me like an adult human. Samsung you treat people like trash because you are trash. Also I'm pretty sure that guys name was NOT Rodger..."
"I stupidly gave Samsung my phone earlier this week for a repair. After 5 days of chasing them up in conjunction with (DPD Parcels), I have been lied to, they both denied having my phone. Then it was lost and no one would admit to its whereabouts. I never thought I'd ever write about Samsung in this way, but they truly deserve it. If I could have given zero stars I would have. I've got a bad disability that requires me to have a phone close at hand. I explained this to both companies, they could not have cared less. I contacted Samsung on the chat service, I was put through to fake names people in the Phillipines. They kept pronouncing things wrong, kept hanging up on me. They kept saying weird stuff like( we have your back ,don't worry). Then I spoke to a lady on the phone at Samsung, she intimated that DPD Parcels was open on a Sunday. I proceeded to call, they were closed. She only said this to get me of off the phone. In conclusion the twitter chat team emailed me saying the following(someone got the paperwork mixed up,we have had your phone for the last five days). I couldn't have been more shocked and angry. And I emailed their head office in Korea, they are as email shy as they are ignorant. I'm still waiting on a response from them too. I would avoid any repairs with Samsung if you want to keep your goods. And as for DPD Parcels, they are worse than useless, I'd avoid them aswell, they are Samsungs main courier. All they did constantly was blame Samsung for the mistake. Sorry the review is a bit glum,but that's been my week of hell, with both of them. I also must state, the phone was sent back because it was heating up and marking my face,after being really caring quoting Health and Safety of their customers,they sent me an engineers report stating my screen was cracked which I already knew, they still could not tell me why my phone was overheating.they said they emailed me an engineers report(which they didnt), and they had phoned my house(which they hadn't either). Ridiculous. A comedy of errors that was not funny at all.Update/ive had more contact from these sheisters-they wont do anything to my phone,instead they find it more appropriate to tell me I use it at my own risk. So in closing, my phone has to stay on loudspeaker so I dont burn my face,I had an independent engineer look at it,they informed me it's nothing to do with my dropping the phone, it's an internal problem. Told Samsung this, they still fobbed me off and said use the phone at my own peril. They are truly shocking. Also dont bother contacting their head office, as they ignore your emails aswell. Big company,put their customers at risk all for the sake of a few quid. Needless to say I will never buy anymore Samsung products ever again."
"Dear Samsung SupportI recently bought a samsung washmachine. After Installation, the machine did not Pump. A technican came in 2 Weeks. After the reparation work. The wooden floor was messed up with the water. All this stress I went through, buying a new wash machine.Thank you for your great quality control!P.s. : The washmachine is great."
"Recently bought 2 Samsung Galaxy A 10.1 inch tablets. Just incredible. I just wanted something I could connect around the house to a wifi. Incredible. The advance in technology is just incredible. Beautiful graphics, quick response and very affordable."
"I have had excellent service from Samsung.  The call center has been professional.  They took the time to listen, I mean really listen to the problem.  Finally, they took steps to not just resolve the issue today but resolve it permanently.  I wish the people who had a negative or hard time would have had the same experience I had."
"I purchased a J7 refine within a month the charging port came loose. It was sent in for repairs which leaves a person without the phone for 3 weeks. I got the phone back and the charging port came loose again. They agreed to have another phone to me in 7 days and it would be a replacement. After 11 days I called. They said it was in the mail and should have it in 1 to 2 days. The next day today they called and said they don't have that phone in stock. They would send a check upon receiving a receipt for the purchase of the phone. I spent all day on the phone trying to solve the problem and come up with a receipt. In the end they will not pay me for what it cost to replace the phone since it was on sale when I purchased it. Not happy with all the lies and not doing what they agreed. Not to mention the charging ports on their phones coming loose. Not the first time. Same problems. Will never by another Samsung phone if this is how they are going to treat there customers. Not happy they wasted 5 plus hours of my time today and still not real resolution to the problem. Plus they won't give me my phone back. So I consider it stolen."
"Got a 65inch 4k tv in November started cutting out from hdmi 1 their call centre couldn't be bothered i looked up issues and told her what seemed to be the fault was a pretty common one she told me tv was fine after many calls eventually got a technician he replaced the whole hdmi and left,30 mins later a no internet wire message came up pings with annoying regularity won't go lady i rang wouldn't help because it was 10 mins to close... could go on but won't moral of this story is Samsung will gladly take your money but really don't want to rectify issues that really shouldn't happen with a 2 month old tv AVOID Samsung shoddy."
"Samsung’s customer service is going to put them out of business! I ordered a TV from their website - it took a month an a half to arrive and then was damaged/defective. Their only solution is for me to return the tv and order a new one. Since the original was ordered on cyber Monday, to get the same discount, I have to order the same tv which is on back order for another month. The whole process to get a tv from Samsung that works will take me 3 months! That seems ridiculous. Samsung doesn’t have a replacement program and no one was sympathetic to the fact that this is the only TV in my house. I could go to Best Buy and receive a new tv same day - how can they efficiently serve their customers if they cannot keep up with services that others offer? I’ll never buy another Samsung again"
"Samsung does not provide customer service, only heaps of frustration.  We've been trying to get Samsung to repair our 65"" television for 2 years now.  After buying better HDMI cables, numerous calls and chat sessions, as well as filing a BBB report they finally sent out Dish technicians to repair the television with new parts.  Two weeks ago, the techs spent over 3 hours replacing the main board, cables and a couple other parts.  They could not get the TV to work properly, so they took it apart again to put all the old parts back.  They had me sign a contract that I couldn't make out, due to the signature area covering the contract on the iPad.  The tech said he would email me a copy of what they did on the contract.  I did receive the contract, but other than my signature, it's completely blank?  Yes, I unwittingly signed a blank contract?  Samsung even told the BBB that the case is resolved, because their techs were fixing it? They did not. I hadn't heard anything from Samsung, so I emailed Montez Gaffney @ Samsung Office of President who had the service techs sent to our home.  He refuses to respond to me or the BBB now, so I'm forced to write reviews and get consumer affairs involved.  Our 2 Panasonic plasma televisions haven't given us a lick of trouble in 7-8 years, but all we've had with this Samsung is 2 years of headaches."
"Samsung monitors and TV's have been working like a dream for years. Good products!"
"Most pathetic business and store around. Raised a complaint over 2 weeks ago, and Samsung Customer Service and the Kings Cross store have done nothing about it. Kings Cross store is uncontactable, which is ironic given they are one of the largest telecommunications company in the industry. Check out all these reviews. Avoid at all costs. Go elsewhere"
"Samsung and customer service should not be on the same sentence (oxymoron) .My experience without Samsung has been horrendous. I purchased a Samsung Dryer from Best Buy less than a month ago. It has manufacturing issue.  The bolt to reverse the door neither tightens or loosens. Instead of trying  to resolve the problem, Samsung is only interested in not providing any customer service. I see there are lot of negative feedback about Samsung here. I wish I read them. I will never purchase a product from Samsung again. Most unethical company I have every come across in my life."
"First, the delivery guys called me every hour starting at 10 am to tell me they would be here in 30 minutes, this lasted until they actually arrived at 4 PM. We purchased a washer and dryer - although their site says it comes with installation included for the bundle they did not provide it. This was also sent to our email, to which they responded that they send the confirmation of installation to everyone, even when it's not included. When I called to inquire about it they said that my only course of action was to return the appliances and re-purchase (mind you, it took 2 months to arrive) with the installation services. I asked if they could hear how stupid and wasteful that sounded, to which the CSR agreed, but said there is nothing else that can be done. This is the most idiotic system I've ever seen.  Screw you Samsung. I would rather buy from anyone else in the future."
"Please beware of this retailer before buying any product! I had bought QE55Q90R Bixby one from them on 21st Nov. Ignoring the 1.5/2 weeks delivery time, the TV was faulty and came in a weird looking packaging inside and outside. The TV isn't working since then with a ticking sound and a connection issue. Raised it immediately with the retailer. Very frustrating dealing with them as they do not have a contact number, all comms are through emails and they are not impromptu in their responses. Dealt with customer service representatives and Sean Cullen and no help at all! They do all trial and error. Sean said ""they are 100% sure, it is the fault with the connecting wire that is between the TV and the connect box"", sent me the replacement wire, it didn't work either!Raised it with SAMSUNG, there have been two SAMSUNG engineer visits already and no resolution. SAMSUNG engineer sent email to SAMSUNG advising that the TV needs replacing but SAMSUNG said they can't replace the TV and asking me to deal with the retailer! I can't anymore deal with the repair services and the TV is within warrantee and I need a replacement ASAP!!I will take this now to legally to the consumer court if the resolution doesn't happen quick! #SAMSUNG. I have sent email to CEO's office in SAMSUNG as escalations and have been speaking with Kirsty Caswell from CEO's office and even with the situation is with SAMSUNG Contact/Repair Center and Engineer advising SAMSUNG for a replacement of this TV, SAMSUNG asking me again and again to deal with the Retailer!SAMSUNG should replace this TV. It is a big brand and I wanted to have a SAMSUNG product but I think it was a worst decision by me!!SAMSUNG - if you are hearing me, please help and take the TV and replace it with a ""non faulty"" TV."
"Epic Tech! I have a phone from Samsung and it is a very fast phone. I would always recommend Samsung to a friend and I love there products. A very good and trustable well-known company."
"Today, I bought a Samsung dvd-recorder. Samsung BD-H8500NTechnically ok,BUT: How can the company publish a manual without page numbers?"
"I purchased a 27.8 refrigerator from Samsung and have had no issues with the frig section..But the Ice Maker has required 5 repair visits by Samsung Repair to get working. Samsung has stepped up to make these repairs with the unit out of warranty and have bent over backwards to help me. Now the Ice Maker has failed again, so I called Customer Service to ask for help today, being all the repair attempts have been recorded with Samsung, they offered to refund the cost of my entire purchase or send me a newer model for free. They are aware of certain models having endless Ice Maker issues and have shown me that they will go far beyond what is expected. Replacing the entire 3 year old refrigerator without having any further repair attempts is outstandin and I will have no problem getting a newer Samsung again. They have helped me with my 65 inch tv a few times out of warranty also which shows me they actually do care...these comments are based on my personal experience as a actual consumer."
"I have had my Samsung Washer Dryer machine for around 11 months, I do a lot of laundry in my house, I dont like to have laundry hanging around so generally do 2 loads a day, most of my loads are around 40-50% of the drum capacity. This machine only likes full loads to wash, anything under 70% full and it wont spin it, so the washing comes out dripping, you have to run a separate spin cycle at least 1s or wash again in a bigger load. Unless you are drying a pair of socks you have to put the machine on the drying cycle at least twice to get a half load dry. Compared to my last 2 washer dryers by other brands it takes at least double the amount of time to get a load washed and dried in this machine. I generally buy a new machine every 3-4 years, I give up with this machine and i'm off to buy a new 1. I'm a working mum and dont have time to sit by the machines side!!"
"I have owned multiple Samsung products from cellphones to refrigerators and washer/dryers. I have been happy with them all. All have worked well for me and have lasted over time."
"When we bought our new home I purchased all new appliances including a $3,000 side by side Samsung refrigerator with an ice maker. The ice maker worked fine until 1 month after the warranty expired. Since then about every 2 months it would freeze up- no ice. I got online when it first happened and found out that there were multiple videos showing how to defrost the ice maker, obviously a common problem. Figuring I would get no where with Samsung I have been defrosting every two months. However, last night it froze again only 2 weeks since the last defrosting so I broke down and called. The representative I spoke to was very nice and admitted it was a common problem which had been reported many times before, but since it was out of warranty I was out of luck. I called the authorized service provider in my area and was told by a technician it would likely be $300- 400 to repair. He didn’t think it was worth it and he couldn’t understand why Samsung wouldn’t take care of problem. I was told by Samsung Rep that problem wouldn’t be taken care of because refrigerator had not been recalled. I asked her what had to be wrong with a refrigerator to be recalled and she just laughed. However, I was told if it broke after being repaired Samsung would pay parts and labor. I don not understand why Samsung will not stand behind their products from the beginning? But, be aware they do not. I do not recommend anyone purchasing a Samsung product. Any company who abandons their customers after point of sale does not deserve to have customers. I personally will never, ever purchase another Samsung product."
"We purchased a refrigerator, washer, and dryer, a few months before moving into our new home while they were on sale. Shortly before our closing date, I called to see about getting our delivery date moved to an earlier day. I found out that our fridge had been discontinued. NO ONE BOTHERED TO TELL US. We picked a new one and when our new delivery day came, we had no fridge, and NO ONE BOTHERED TO CALL. I made a call and found that our stuff had not made it to the delivery agent on time. That would have been good to know so I wouldn't have spent my day at home waiting for nothing to show up. We only had our fridge for two weeks before it was finally picked up. It arrived with some small dents, but nothing that affected the functionality. (Our washer and dryer had damage too, but they work great. Seems like Samsung doesn't package their stuff well.) It worked fine, but did not fit in the space we had like we thought it would. When I opened the doors on the right side, they did not open all the way and I couldn't pull out the drawers very far. (The smart fridges are big and don't come in a smaller size.) There was no lack of space for food, just not a good option if you don't have a space designed for a large fridge. Since we chose to not keep it, we didn't mess with the smart features so I don't know if they are all that great or not. After reading reviews on the website, I'm glad we didn't keep it. Sounds like the ice maker has a lot of issues. Samsung wanted to come out and basically see if I was telling the truth. I realize there are people out there that just like to cause trouble and tell lies, but I don't make these kind of calls for no reason. (I loathe making phone calls.) If I call you to tell you that your product isn't working for me, it's the truth. I have better things to do with my time. (We just moved into a new home! I was plenty busy!) I ended up working with a gentleman from where we bought it from and it was picked up. I was going to get a different Samsung fridge, but after all of the the terrible service and phone calls, I went with a different brand. I had to have that same gentleman help me get my refund as it had been over a MONTH since the fridge had been picked up. I will not be using Samsung again unless I absolutely have to, or their customer service DRASTICALLY improves.  If you have had a great experience with them, I am truly happy for you. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me and I think others should know."
"Poor customer service advisors very rude and helpful the warranty is a waste of The paper it's written on Samsung not interested waste of space avoid at all costs will never purchase a samsung product again disgusted with them a company as large as they are you would expect decent customer support unfortunately it’s non existent"
"I am very unhappy with new S10. Looked my S6 better.Especially miss blinking light letting me know about new messages."
"I have had Samsung phones for over 10 years and a Samsung DVD player for 6 years.  Not a problem in all of these years!  Whenever I have had a question and call, the helpline is super with their help! Great company."
"I purchased a Galaxy Note 10 plus and I had it not even a month it was infected with malware and everything else inside of the coating of the operating system of the phone I then had to place an insurance claim on it. So that was another hundred dollars I had to put out so after that they gave me this phone and this phone has malware infected inside of its operating system so do not buy anymore Samsung products they are all getting eaten by hackers these systems are all infected then they are all connected it's like a cyberdyne system!!!! Oh, btw within 3 minutes of this going up I now have a supervisor acting like they care smh!!!!!!! So I was also just cheated out of money I spent when they told me my IMEI was from some random cricket phone!!!!! If u have a similar issue, simply place a claim with the BBB for whatever the cost of the products were, usually within a week they get your money back and it leaves a permanent scar on their record!!!! I just got completely brushed off and said that someone else will deal with it. What happened to them?"
"My name is Elbin Ramos If I could give -0000000 I would.  1.  Placed and order on Dec 2, 2019 and financing was directly with Samsung.  2.  Washer and dryer was delivered on Dec 5, by XPOLogistic but a returned was requested this same date. 3.  Dec 11, 2019 washer and dryer was picked up by XPOLogistic. 4. Dec 12 and 16 called for status on the returned but they did not know nothing.  Requested escalation for Samsung Finance not to charge me but nothing has been done and here I am with a Statement closing date on December 19, 2019, no washer no dryer and what is worst no credit applied on Samsung Finance card and the worst no body can answer on what is going on.  If you don't want your health or sleep to be affected STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.  If I only would have read all the bad reviews I would not bee going thru hell this is emotional and time consuming."
"I bought a TV for the holidays in their Samsung Upgrade payment plan. Instead of being billed monthly as the plan stated I was billed in full overdrafting my account. I've tried twice to get the billing corrected and they're not helping in any way. In fact when I insisted on returning it they said I have to wait 24 hours before they can process it."
"Very poor. Used bait and switch for promo earbuds. Never received claimed sent emails by them of switch to coupon code.   No apologies.  No help.  No earbuds.  No more Samsung products at my home. Negative reports to friends."
"Great products but they do not honored my Galaxy Note 9 warrantyAsked them to sell me some earphones but they didn't want my money I guess"
"My new Note 10+ phone reboots during phone calls. The phone is unusable without several reboots a day. Samsung say it ""Meets Manufacturers Specifications"" and refuses to exchange or refund the phone. I am taking them to tribunal, but this will take months to resolve.  I will never buy another Samsung device again."
"Samsung refrigerator keeps frosting up and no help from Samsug.Beware of their refrigerators."
"Purchased a Samsung S5e tablet on line at samsung.com during its product launching last April 25th.May 2019, my problems started. Samsung replaced the tablet but I discovered that the tablet replaced was a 64 GB and not the 128 GB I paid for. I had to beg and wait for more than a month for Samsung to give me the shipping label.  I shipped the wrong tablet Samsung gave me since Oct 2019. Its already December 9th and still no replacement and no resolution. I offered to get a refund and for the past 2 weeks the case managers have been telling me to wait because its with upper management.   My case has been ongoing for 8 months now, and I am desper"
"I got charged twice for a phone that I bought. I thought something that should be rectified would have been easy to do. I called, spent well over an hour on the phone. I was told to hold ""for just a couple minutes"" multiple times. Finally I was told that the refund would come within 2 to 3 business days. After the third business day it has still not been rectified. I called again. Again I have spent well over an hour on the phone, got my call dropped, had to call back and am still being made to wait. The absolute worst service I have ever had for anything, and I have been using Xfinity for the last 5 years or so. They are a customer's dream compared to Samsung."
"Purchased A Samsung POWERbot R7040 Robot Vacuum a few months ago. I am not sure if I received a defective product but even with a full charge it will shut off in the middle of cleaning and I have to manually switch it off and back on. I'm always receiving error messages on my phone saying to put the dock on a flat surface which is it. It sits perfectly flat on my wood floors. I bought this product because of the great reviews and the price was better than Roomba. I am unable to return the vacuum and I'm not happy with it at all. I should have spent the extra money on the roomba or got the POWERbot R9250 but it was to expensive at the time. Customer service was no help either. Neither was customer service from Best Buy."
"COMPANY AND IT'S MOST BASIC CS IS ABSURD. ABSURDLY HORRIFIC. RELATIVE IS PLANNING ON BUYING ONE IF NOT, THE, MOST EXPENSIVE TV THEY SELL. HE BUYS SOUND BAR ACCESSORIES FIRST. TELLS ME ABOUT. THEN REFERS ME AND WE BOTH JOIN REFERRAL PROGRAM. HE SENDS ME A 5% CODE FOR MY ACCESSORY I WANT TO BUY. OF COURSE, CODE DOESN'T WORK. 3 HRS ONLINE WITH CHAT, MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS, ONE DISCONNECTED, POLITE REQUESTS TO ESCALATE SIMPY QUESTION, ONE LADY REP W BROKEN ENGLISH TALKS OVER ME AND SAYS SHE CAN'T GIVE ME A SIMPLY YES OR NO ANSWER TO A SIMPLE YES OR NO QUESTION!!! QUESTION: DOES ""ADVOCATE"" SENDING REFERRAL CODE HAVE TO REGISTER THEIR PRODUCT BEFORE REFERRAL CODE ACTIVATES? (YES OR NO?) IF SO, HOW CAN ONE REGISTER PRODUCT ORDERED ON LINE PRIOR TO RECEIPT? 5% REFERRAL CODE GIVEN GIVES ""INVALID CODE"" ERROR MSG ON CHECKOUT WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION. IF SAMSUNG IS READING THIS, PLS MAKE SIMPLY AND OFFER TO CREDIT BACK TO MY CHARGE CARD 5% OF WHATEVER I BUY? OR SUPPLY WORKING CODES. GEESH. WHAT 3 + HOURS ON CHAT AND PHONE SUPPORT AND NOT ONE REP CAN OFFER ANSWERS OR RESOLUTION?! WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I BUY YOUR MANY THOUSAND DOLLAR TV AND HAVE ISSUES WITH IT? HOW CAN I EXPECT ANY LEVEL OF SUPPORT WHATSOEVER? YOU USED TO BE A GREAT COMPANY. WHAT HAPPENED? VERY DISAPPOINTED. AND UPSET."
"Do yourself a favour and don't buy anything made by Samsung. The quality is not great for a premium product and customer service is virtually non existant.I personally will avoid Samsung in future as both my TV's and my American fridge freezer have developed faults.Samsung customer service are not at all helpful."
"waiting for cash back under the 'out of this world' promotion.  the claim was validated on 2 October. they emailed me to confirm payment would be made 'within 30 days'.  despite me phoning both samsung and OPIA [the company who administer promotions for samsung and many other companies worldwide] many times i haven't been paid. seems samsung really do not care about their customers."
"I have been calling Samsung for 2 solid weeks.  I’ve spoken to over 10 people.  They all promise to help, but never do.  I get disconnected or transferred with no help in sight.  My tv is a year old and just over the warranty.  It just stopped working and won’t go on.DONT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!"
"If I could give -5 stars I would! TOTAL RIPOFF! NEVER BUY ANY samsuck crap, ALL OF THIER STUFF IS JUNK! samsung=crap & thier so called ""customer service"" is the absolute worst! Warranty is a complete joke! they make you pay for repairs on thier lameass defective junk, just a bunch of greedy thieves! Only buy American made or you're asking for problems!"
"Samsung really went down in quality. Both their service and product quality went downhill the past few years. The only reason I'm rating them a 3 star is because I love their SSDs. Their SSD rocks! But that's all there is to it. Everything else just plain sucks."
"Samsung support and customer service are both complete trash.11 months into a 12 month warranty the TV stopped turning on. Instant dumpster fire of an experience.Do Not Buy Samsung ANYTHING. If you do and have a problem with it you will end up dealing with low-rent, third-party service centers and never get an actual resolution.The only thing the reps on the phone/chat (EVEN WHEN ""ESCALATED"") can do is follow a script and make excuses."
"18 months worth of phone calls to try and get an issue with a £1600 tv sorted, constantly past back and forth, none of there customer service or help lines have resolved the issue. Samsung refuse to sort the tv and say its currys where the tv was purchased issue to resolve. Currys are not interested so I'm left with a tv that doesn't work properly. AVOID SAMSUNG PRODUCTS AS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AS BAD AS IT GETS"
"I currently have a literal home full of Samsung products. Have literally has 10s of thousands of dollars of product through the years. I have now received the absolute worst customer service I have ever received. All over an $80 item. Samsung has now lost a very loyal customer. Glad business is so great that you can afford to not care about the customer. Absolutely horrible. Done with EVERYTHING Samsung!!!"
"DO NOT PURCHASE A SAMSUNG PRODUCT! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! On top of my brand new refrigerator breaking it is impossible to get Samsung to send out a service person! I have been waiting 3 weeks for a repair person! Customer service representatives have been rude and condescending! Apparently they have 1 person to service the entire TRI-STATE area! It seems they are playing a waiting game hoping I will get frustrated and pay someone else to fix my UNDER WARRANTY refrigerator!"
"Worst customer service ever!!! It's like no customer service! Sent samsung my purchased tab s6 keyboard cover for exchange. They received it 20 days ago. No one at Samsung can tell me why my new cover has not been sent out yet. I've spoken to someone from their case management team 4 times and all they tell me is they have to send an email to the exchange dept because there is no direct line to speak with someone. (I WOULD LOVE TO WORK IN AN OFFICE WHERE NO ONE COULD GET IN TOUCH WITH ME!)  I've been told this 3 times. I have also been told they have escalated the request, whatever that means. Obvoiusly nothing. No one follows up and I've spent at least 3 hours on the phone with them. Samsung customer service is the worst service I have ever encountered. unbelievable from a company I have purchased many products from but will never again"
"Very easy to set up smart TV with Samsung app from my phone. All my accounts were linked and added."
"Excellent company, order came in a timely matter and customer service was top notch when helping set up."
"Please note before you purchase, that this Samsung tablet and similar Samsung devices does not have a magnetometer, (compass), chip and no barometric chip, (altimeter), rendering it useless, or with limited functionality for most navigation apps and for Stellarium augmented reality mode, (point at the object in the sky and see what it is on the tablet or phone). No warning messages with regard to this are displayed on the product specifications.The compass function has been and still is, standard on most phones tablets and ipads. If you try to download a compass on a number of newer Samsung tablets you will get this message...UNSUPPORTED DEVICE. Unfortunately this device doesn't have a magnetometer sensor. No compass app will work on your device.I have spent some time (1hour 20mins.) on the Samsung chat line but to no avail.The tablet was purchased from Currys/PCWorld in the City of Bath on September 6th 2019, 37 days before the problem was reported, (14/10/19) it was only until then that I discovered the problem. We shall see what the response is from Currys/PCWorld. I will report back later.Watch this space......"
"I have bought Galaxy S8 on the 11th September 2018 in Brazil in the official shop. One year later on 13th September 2019 it stopped working suddenly. I was trying to communicate with online support center, they asked me to make a two tips of restart but nothing helped. When it is connected for charging the battery is warm. As I'm living in Cape Verde Islands, the phone was bought in brasil while I was on vacations, so I can't go there again especially for this case. This year I went to Portugal and visited the official crevice center but thy told me that they can't repair as it was not bought in European Union. How is it possible? One year of working for samsung smartphone? No one is responsible? Official crevices doesn't want even to make diagnostics? It's like to throw away 700euros!!! Horrible service!!!"
"Purchased a Samsung washing machine which came with a 5 year warranty for false sense of security. After one year the lock on the door was broken and I contacted samsung to get it repaired. 5 weeks later still waiting. And there customer service, repairs and resolutions have been vile. Do not buy from them. I wish I didn't. Not worth the hassle."
"We've been loyal Samsung customers for over a dozen years.  Cell phones,  mostly,  but this spring I bought a tab A at Costco. In less than six months,  it died.  Would not charge or turn on.  Shipped it back to Samsung on August 23. On August 25, I was notified that it was unrepairable,  and I agreed to a replacement. I was assured that I would have my replacement within 14-21 business days.  Emails are not answered.  Promised call backs never happen. Phone calls reveal numerous steps,  each one requiring ""7-9"" business days.  Each step is taking longer than promised,  ie it has now been waiting for ups to pick up for 10 business days.  It is now October, and the supervisor I spoke to this morning tells me that,  ""hopefully,  you'll have it before the 15th"". There is a culture within the company that says it's okay to sell defective products,  drag out replacing said product as long as possible,  lie to, and ignore customers, and make the process add difficult as possible. Add to that,  I've been informed that the warranty on this new tablet still runs from my original date of purchase,  so I've lost 2 months of warranty coverage,  and when this one dies in less than 6 months,  I will be out of luck.  Never again."
"Bought the S10+ in Sweden where I currently live but don't speak Swedish. Was looking to ask support about poor fingerprint performance as phone is too expensive for this kind of poor performance but couldn't. If you use Samsung Members it does not let you send messages if you don't have Swedish keyboard set as default. Same for the web page if you want to change the language you need to be located in some other country. When somehow I got to the page with google translate to write a query I got the reply 6 days after telling me I'm complaining on Samsung Content & Services and I should be doing it on Samsung Electronics. So for extra expensive phone you get worst fingerprint sensor for that money, no customer support, battery that last less than a day with low settings on and disabled everything, bixby that hounts you down and there's no way of actually disabling her,  no common sens of including English language in support app for every region as people can actually move to some country without knowing the language... Extremely disappointed as the main reason I switched to Samsung was expectancy that such a company has great support/customer care. I'm considering paying 4000 SEK more to Telenor to switch phone under a month to Huawei P30 Pro as I avoided it because of support. At least I'll get a good phone that way as it appears not much companies have any kind of useful customer support."
"Everything I bought from Samsung turned faulty within first year..Two phones and laptop, but the latest disaster is Samsung eco bubble washer dryer.Broke down three times now within the first year of purchase yet no one at Samsung so called president office has bothered to help.Some  liar in head office,   promised a replacement when it first broke down, then that went to if it should break down again, it did and  then went back on her word. She hijacked emails to ceo so he can not see them to resolve.It has broken down again flooding my kitchen.She should be sacked.Samsung should be banned from UK, selling second hand items as new they are fraud traders.Stay in their third world slum, Korea or China wherever and the directors all three of them should face police investigation.Crooks."
"So bought a Q60r TV and their Soundbar direct from Samsung, assuming you would get the same service as other manufacturers or leading retailers... how wrong. I wanted guaranteed delivery and although both items were ordered at once, I had to pay two separate charges for the guaranteed delivery. Delivery was late and so contacted customer support and was told I would be refunded. TV and Sound bar both had faults, either no display but sound, or no sound from the sound bar but display from the TV. Was not happy having spent £1,300 so contacted Support again and was advised nothing they could do apart from refund or replace. Owing to the appalling service I opted for a refund and so items were collected. 3 weeks and countless calls and promises of call backs , still no refund! I had luckily used PayPal and opened a dispute for my refund. They ruled in my favour and I eventually got my money refunded. Never buy from Samsung direct!"
"So after buying a flagship K series Samsung TV for nearly £1500, I have had problem and problem - and now the TV is out of warranty it has suffered the dreaded “power cycling” where it will come on and then immediately turn off and then back on again and then off etc. Etc.This is a known manufacturing defect and there is a Class Action suit in the USA from consumers there. Not happy with the shambolic previous lawsuit they lost for rubbish TVs and the sheer embarrassment of exploding phones, they have to throw more fuel onto the self-destruction fire by not standing by their products.I have spoken to countless customer service reps and eventually emailed the UK President, who didn’t even bother to look at the email and it was instead dealt by a robotic minion with no empathy or care.I will never buy any Samsung product again - the build quality is based on bargain bin components and for myself these Smart TVs are just like Toshiba, Sharp, Sanyo and Phillips - bargain basement tat. I really believe this poor quality is now inherent across all their products,Will stick with Sony going forward - Samsung could learn something from them, but I suspect they won’t and in 5 years time will be crying when they have lost customer advocacy and market share,Please save yourself the headache and avoid these fly-by-night mercenaries - bunch of clowns who behave like they are in a circus."
"Great company.Best in this business."
"Paid over $1200 for a S9+ and 14 months later the fingerprint sensor is defective. Samsung will not cover it because it's over the 12 months, I would have to pay out of pocket. Apple treated me better when I had an iPhone. Poor quality workmanship, poor customer service. I've been purchasing samsung phones since the s3 (I have 2 samsung tv's, washer, dryer, fridge stove and dishwasher) when it comes time to replace these items I definitely will not buy samsung products again, ."
"Worst customer service company I have ever deal with.  Will not EVER buy another Samsung product and will send POS product back.Got the new Note 10+ after 2 1/2 weeks found out that the IMEI number is invalid, try to register and still invalid. Customer service gave me the round around for 3 weeks and NO solution, now unable to exchange because had 15 days.I am supposed to pay for a phone that can NOT use legally. Nice job Samsung .... .Will file a formal complain with BBB, etc."
"I've spent thousands of dollars on samgung washer and dryer/ dishwasher/ frig(4,000 -just for that). Terrible products- nothing works worth a darn. They send people out to tell you it's your fault. Save yourself a nightmare and DO NOT BUY this JUNK!"
"Wow.I am the victim of a KNOWN major issue.Can't post link unfortunately.Spots developed a year ago, only 1.5 years old TV. It has since got worse and i thought i'd contact them and unfortunately a TV under 3 years old they can do nothing to help me.How long are TV's supposed to last? i have a 30 year old Panasonic CRT here working!!!Complete rubbish, being a known issue i contacted ACL and am going legal action because Consumer Law dictates they have to help!"
"Bought a device, sent it back defective. Three devices and a year later, my money bought me about three months of working tech. These are devices with all your info and data: financial, personal, you name it. The rest of the time Samsung had it. They can keep it as long as they want to. They decide how to handle it. You have no recourse, and you're at their mercy completely. They never refund, and they are motivated to use up your warranty time until it's gone."
"If only I could give ZERO stars. My monitor breaks while under manufacturer warranty. I chat online with samsung support, basic troubleshooting steps, no big deal. ""Please put in a service request"". No problem, or so I thought. ""We are sorry, but we currently don't have service available in your area, please call"". Fine. I call, automated system of course, and it transfers me. First person interrupted me while speaking, ""We're not Samsung"", and transferred me. Next person answers, interrupts me while speaking, ""This is the TV department, you're in the wrong place"". Finally the 3rd person put in the request for me, which I could have done myself. I carefully confirm the address, which is correct. I get the e-mail for the service request and I'm excited to finally get some resolution. Then I notice the phone number is wrong. So I call the 3rd party, USSI, and the ""lead tech"" answers with a huge chip on her shoulder, tells me the system is down and she can't update it right now but will later. Given the problems thus far, I ask for some kind of confirmation when it is updated. She tells me there is no confirmation, and also interrupts me while speaking, seemingly irritated that I would have the gall to ask for confirmation on this. She was unusually condescending during the entire conversation and it was obvious she didn't want to hear anything I was talking about, which was odd for someone whose job it is to answer these calls. I was polite and assertive. I feel angry and disrespected, and I shouldn't feel like this when Samsung's equipment fails."
"The Samsung TV q7 series with One connect and One Remote is probably the most Not-Smart TV I have ever experienced.Calling it Smart TV is fake marketing.Channels cannot be mixed in favorite groups from two different dvb-antennas ( for example dvb-s and dvb-t)If you rename a fav. group in dvb-s for example to ""German Channels"" then it will also be called ""German Channels"" when using dvb-t but only contains the dvb-t channels that are not German.. Really smart ..So the channels from ""each "" dvb you can not see / switch to/ channels from both dvb- antennes can not be stored in same fav. list, only the name of the fav group is the same ( the channels are not)To switch from a dvb-t channel eg DR to a dvb-s channel eg ARD, 11 key presses must be used. (minimum if both channels are ranked as channel # 1 in the favorites lists.)The only option is to buy a separate combined satellite/dvb-t receiver with its own remote control, whereby the One-Remote philosophy runs down the drain.There are no apps for DR. (Danish National TV) To watch streams from DR, you need to buy an Android TV box or a Chromecast, whereby the One-Remote philosophy goes down the drain - again- as we are now on at least 3 remote controls ...Samsung Support has used almost 2 months to respond and they have no solutions to any problems, -only I can use 11 button-presses to switch from one channel to another, which they consider a solution-  besides I can complain to DR about a missing app for Titzen. In other words, The TV is NOT a One Remote TV nor a One-Connect TV.The smart function that should copy your wall behind the TV to the screen when in ""sleep-mode"" is photo-shopped, in real life it looks like a joke.The TV looks nice when it is turned off and not in use."
"Best company. Products are of great quality."
"I personally use Samsung devices and really like them."
"I have a fridge that is not even 6 years old. Samsung admittedly changed the filter design and now it no longer fits my fridge. When I contacted them they actually told me that I needed to go pay for a modification to my fridge. MY FRIDGE THAT ISN'T EVEN 6 YEARS OLD! They do not care. I contacted a Mr. Appliance franchise and they told me this was the normal for Samsung and that no one should ever buy their products. Learned to late, but will not forget."
"Terrible customer service they have a long way to go to compete with Apple. Description of Studio stand is not correct on their website-they state it as black but in fact it is brown. While trying to resolve this issue it was painful dealing with their customer support. In the end there response was take it or leave it, no apology or acknowledgement."
"I received an email that I needed to pay for a repair at 3:33pm. I attempted to make the payment at 4:20pm when I returned home. Their system kept giving me an error that my card was expired. I called in and they told me that they had my billing zip code wrong. They corrected it and charged my card $258.72 for the screen repair. 2 minutes later I get an email that my ticket was cancelled for non-payment and they are sending the phone back un-repaired. I check my bank and the money was debited so I call Samsung and they tell me that I would have to call back on Monday since the department that cancels and reactivates tickets is not in on weekends... I then ask how they could cancel the ticket on a Saturday if they are not in? No answer from the overseas rep other than to call in on Monday! So now I have no idea if they are sending the device back un-repaired or if it's a system error. Horrible service and it would be nice if they didn't send their US based customers to customer service reps overseas that are simply people reading notes and asking customers to call back! Oh, and don't get me started on the refrigerator I bought for $2500 that freezes up every month! Total crap products and service!"
"sent in note 9 cell phone after 8 months old and the s pen stopped working sent in in and its now been 4 weeks and counting over 15 calls into the customer service and still can not even give me an answer of what is going on.The worst service I have ever dealt with in my life and stay far away anything with that name on it, as they do not stand behind their product and the people working there are useless to say the least.Garbage product and customer service Going back to Apple"
"Terrible! Bought a $2500 Samsung QLED TV, that is having awful blooming, the stand is not straight and after repeated service attempts by the reseller Elkjop.no the product has been further damaged, but not repaired.We have not had a functioning TV for six months after choosing to buy the Samsung TV. The huge/heavy TV has been sent for service three times and it gets more damaged and less usable/worth for every service visit.Samsung and the reseller Elkjop.no denies all responsibility and will not accept a return of the TV, that we have now logged 6-8 (repeated) faults/problems with. I am shocked to learn that this level of service can happen today at all.Never again a Samsung branded product. Never."
"Worst customer service EVER! I was showing my mom a YouTube video on my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 about 5 minutes before we got home. When we got home I went to message one of my friends on Twitter and it said my phone had no connection. Also, my phone was charging very slowly for some reason. Long story short, I tried contacting Samsung customer service for 6 hours and couldn't get a hold of anyone."
"They don’t care about their customers. I will never use Samsung again to apple I go. I got the galaxy watch for Christmas, sent in for repair March 20th got back and they did something  to the device to make it not connect to LTE service anymore . Send it back again in May they said they cannot fix it and sent it back.  Then I tried to get help for my carrier Verizon they did everything they could possibly do to help me and Directed me to reach out to Samsung again. When I reached out the third time is of the product that I received an email saying that it will be sent back to me and they cannot fix it. Then I will send another email saying being replaced. It was only communication I got with them even though they promised me and many times a call within 24 hours after my wasted time on the phone. I sent the watch and four weeks ago still do not have a watch shipped out or do not know when it will ship out. I have requested a refund from the company since I’ve had the watch for eight months and I have not been able to use it for five of those eight months and for about two of those eight months the company itself has had it.  They  told me they cannot offer me a refund and just give me a product but I have no idea when it will come I have given up enough waiting and my time and just want my money back for a product that hardly ever worked ."
"I was the victim of false advertising on the shop Samsung app and now lost out on the promotional credit due to that and the fact that it took 1 week of run around by the support team. I am a long time loyal customer of Samsung and was basically told by the last person I spoke to there is nothing they can do to help me and the computer glitch was not there fault. Which is wrong because if you advertise a product for a lower price than you charge that is *False Advertising*. If I had more free time and patience I'd already be talking to my attorney but I dont. Extremely upset and will not be recommending buying anything from Samsung's websites/app again"
"Samsung is the most unethical company I have ever experienced.  From The general consumer call centers to the office of the president, Samsung is corrupt and does not care about consumers.  I mistakenly purchased a product that needed repairs.  The product was repaired multiple times, and on the final repair, Samsung had canceled the repair ticket and STOLE my product!  Left empty handed and only with ultimatums from Samsung I had very few options.  Samsung lawyers lie through their teeth and because they are such a large corporation nobody else will stand up and help the consumer.  The most disgusting part about the whole situation is Samsung violating my consumer rights, my rights has a United States citizen.  I challenge each and every one of you that reads my horror story to not give a dime to this company, they don't belong in the United States!"
"Today I visited Samsung service centre at ameerpet it was very bad experience  who all are visited today from past 2 days there is server issue in this center and there is no manager are in charge is there to retifie this issue they all least bother to customer service if u can't handle like this major issues how can customer will belive  on sumsung this is highly negligence of the team Even I am trying to call other outlets from hear but there is no response from them also...The services are very worst in Samsung service center this why customers are moving to local repair persons"
"Let me say, I have loved my Samsung phone, until the recent update, a week or so ago.My phone is now slower and switches screen for no reason. I hate this so much, I am looking at buying a new phone from another manufacturer. You ruined a perfectly good phone with your so called update."
"Used to be a Samsung Galaxy fan and user until they made several unauthorized charges to my bank account on my last cell phone purchase. Thinking they would help me out promptly, I wrote on their customer service support page asking for my money to be refunded. After jumping through impediments and giving them the information they asked for, they simply refused. I am never spending another dollar on this overpriced company. So much for loyalty. Next phone I’ll purchase will be an iPhone."
"I sent in my Galaxy buds after they were malfunctioning. I was told it would take 5 days maximum for the replacement ones to arrive and that I would receive a update call on the third day. None if these claims actually happened and now 4 calls with customer service has gotten me nowhere. I have now waited 10 days almost two weeks since I sent in my defective pair. This is extremely poor customer service and should be addressed immediately."
"I bought Samsung note 9 on Samsung webside on November 2018. after I updated software Samsung note 9 on July 10th 2019. My phone, the wifi is shut down no more connect to my wifi any more. I reset it , but It is not working. I called Samsung support to fix it free in 1 year warranty. They fixed, but my phone damaged around the phone by them ( Samsung Department Repair). I called Samsung, they said the damaged white dots around the phone, they can't do any thing about this issue. I spend $1000 dollars , they damaged it by repair service that Big Samsung company in the world said like this, unbelievable.Tuong Nguyen7038958837"
"My real rating is 0, but I am a Do It Youself fixer/repair-anything, so I found workarounds for the several Galaxy Note 4's and the two Note 8's that I own.  The Note 4, imo, was the last great small-business productivity cell phone, but only if you didn't update the OS from Android 5, and the WakeLock app was running in ""partial"" model, in the background.  The Rogers store manager who sold me one of the last Note 4's in Canada warned me, ""do not update the OS"".  He saved me a lot of grief.  However, he should have also mentioned, to set Play Store to *not* update apps automatically.  Because I am a former computer security person at a law firm, I am able to change many of the default settings, so that my Note 4's all work optimally, securely.  Fixing a Note 4 today, 2019, requires the ""freezer trick"".  Since the Note 8 has a fixed battery, it might be nigh impossible to reset if it bricks itself.  My Note 8's [and their curved screens, which have imo no advantage] are protected by wallet cases with the tallest raised edges I could find, a trial-and-error method of buying from Amazon and retail stores."
"Incredibly bad customer service. We ordered a wireless phone charger directly from Samsung. The address on the order confirmation and invoice was CORRECT. Somehow they gave the wrong address to FedEx, denied that that was possible, but per the tracking number still delivered it two streets away. We called and emailed Samsung numerous times and they absolutely refused to acknowledge their error or assist in any way. Here is their email response: ""I am contacting you in regards to your Samsung order. I understand that you've stated you did not receive your order. An investigation was sent up to the warehouse but they have shown the carrier has marked this as delivered. Due to the order being marked delivered there is nothing further we can do. We suggest filing a claim with the carrier for the lost item(s) well as contacting your local authorities to file a police report. If you receive a police report you may attach the file and send it to us so that we may re-open the investigation. I apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused. Thank you for choosing Samsung, we hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!"" SAMSUNG is the shipper - FedEx, cannot do anything for the recipient. The SHIPPER has to file the claim. We tried to explain this over and over to no avail. Filing a police report over something THEY sent to the wrong address seemed equally ridiculous. I've never before been treated this incredibly bad over an item that was somehow lost in transport - or any other customer service issue. Therefore finally, I gave up and drove to the house the charger was delivered to, however, nobody lived there. I told one of the neighbors what had happened and a couple of days later we had the charger (with the wrong address printed on it) at our front door. Samsung never replied to the open ticket. Six months later the cable to the charger started smoking and melted. I called customer service again. During this 1 1/2 hr useless conversation with someone who barely spoke English, I was told that if there was no personal injury or property damage, they were going to do nothing about the PHONE as it is out of warranty (yes, I had explained several times it was a WIRELESS CHARGER, yet he kept referring to the phone - so weird). After waiting for a supervisor forever, and much further explaining, they finally agreed to send a new charger, that will probably go the wrong address. We can't wait."
"The first lady I talked to in the phone told me to reset sound settings and my wifi connection was reset as well. The guy I talked to kept talking over me and not answering my questions."
"This bug have now haunted me since 2012 and Samsung still haven't been able to fix it. Been persistent through 3 different Samsung phones.I set an alarm, and then it does NOT! go off. It doesn't do anything until you pick up the phone and activate the screen.Have lost a lot of money due to this because how do you people get up in the morning when you can't even make an alarm clock work correctly????Told them about it many times. they claim it is impossible. I guess they believe in Santa claus too."
"I spent 4 months dealing with Samsung US's customer service representatives trying to figure out how to use samsung financing and get my phone to me while I am living abroad and nobody is currently at my billing address. It took 2.5 months to get the information that the shipping address if using samsung financing has to be the same as the billing address. And with any credit card you have to spell the billing address exactly as it is written on your credit card statement. I have never had this problem anywhere before. Where the difference between RD, rd. , Road and road caused samsung to cancel my order. Then the promotions changed. So my trade-in deal that I had ordered for $200, became $350, which would have been great had it not taken speaking to 3 representatives to get someone to give me a certified 7 day extension for the trade in because i was having friends who i was meeting up with abroad bring me the new phone and send my old phone back once they returned to the U.S. by then the trade in deal was $150, and now after having the phone for 6 days I go online to see that my phone is now $350 again. I have never felt so disrespected as a customer, a consumer, someone who wanted to continue buying a samsung phone and thought it would be easier to get it from the source rather than best buy, whose customer service is almost as bad as samsung's has been.Samsung's ""feedback survey"" only allows for 250 character responses when i tried to ask the one guy who was actually helping me, and who actually provided me with a $50 promo code (that expires) to make up for the $200 to $150 difference of the time i purchased a phone and they canceled it, he answered the second question in the message as if ignoring my request for a better method for filing a complaint."
"Over a year ago I purchased a vacuum cleaner from Samsung. It worked fine for about 6 months, and once it broke, they tried to fix it once, sent it back without trying to fix it the second time, told me I'd get a replacement the third time, which never came, then after a couple more months promised me a refund instead in exchange for an indemnification. I wrote into the indemnification that I wanted my refund first before its conditions would apply (to forfeit rights to sue them). The refund never came. About two or more times per month I contacted them with promises to escalate the issue. Eventually I contacted the offices of Young Hoon Eom, the Samsung US president and CEO. While I did not talk to him directly, one of his representatives talked to me and sent me the refund plus $50 compensation for all my trouble. ."
"I have been trying to get this phone since dec. I have all the proof that I had purchased this phone. My son really wanted the galaxy skin and since dec I have purchasing all Samsung products. First two new phones, then the Samsung top load washer and front load dryer, a tablet, an s10 plus, etc etc...all brand new!I called Samsung because my son was really looking forward to the galaxy skin. The promo ended but I was still going to see if they could honor it since I have records of purchasing BEFORE THE PROMO ENDED!!!! I was excited to hear 4 days ago the customer service rep said she would call me back and they were (samsung)going to make that happen.with the 4th of July I thought the holiday was just making the timing out of whack ... so four days later I called and customer service didn’t even look at the notes, just said we can’t do that. They would not have told you that... soooooo now IM THE LIAR? It was after I asked her can you look up my name and number and tell me who I spoke with then so I can see what is going on. She then told me she has to read the notes... ;(shouldn’t you do that prior to telling a customer they couldn’t have possibly heard the rep correctly? Just saying...) so then she comes back on and states the two times I called were disconnected calls and there are no further notes... (ummmmm.... I only called one time prior to this)I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor because someone is being dishonest, she would not disclose the other person I spoke with either.The supervisor gets on and says there’s no way to get the skin. (I’m ok with thatsue to promo and all... well not really because I did try to purchase the phones prior to it ending and am STULL WAITING FIR MY REFYND FIR THAT PURCHASE!) WHAT I AM EVEN MORE SO OK WITH IS THE LYING TO ME, MISLEADING ME, NOT BEING TRUSTWORTHY AND GETTING MY SONS HOPES UP!!!!)so the supervisor continues to make excuses about maybe the rep was new and didn’t know. I stated she put me on hold to ask her supervisor! So she verified it and her name is infront of you on your computer (if she was even checking which I doubt).Supervisor then said well maybe the supervisor was new and didn’t know how it worked. I said so everyone is new that works there? Or is it you lack training? She didn’t answer so I said NO , it’s simple... I was lied to! And the fact that my acct said my call was disconnected when I actually ended the call grateful saying thank you and giving her another number to reach me at after she was able to get the skin resolved seems a little shady to me.... my products are all within time frame to return!That may seem steep to some but YOUR NOT GOING TO GET MY MONEY WHEN YOUR SHADY CRAP KEEPS GOING ON!we had to exchange the first two washer and dryer sets because they were defective!!!! SAMSUNG YOUR COMPANY IS NOT IN THE LEAST WHAT I THOUGHT! And I will be posting this EVERYWHERE I CAN SO OTHERS KNOW!i will revise it to give explicit details on the products and what we purchased in the last 7 months. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS WORTH AND WHAT WENT WRONG WITH EACH ALREADY!I might add I stated I’ll try calling epic games to see if they can do something and  help... she literally stated EPIC GAMES IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. (Samsung works for epic games and answers for them now)"
"Worst customer service ever. Getting the run around for 2 months for my $80.00 uflex headset. Still not resolved."
"Samsung , hold your head in shame !To not honour your advertised warranty is a shameful thing to do.From 340 reviews you have a one star rating , this should tell all customers something about your company and products."
"It took 10 hours to get a support agent to get my phone sent to the repair center, it took two weeks. They didn't fix it, I called again and they ended up fixing it. They sent my phone back but not the box and accessories. They sent dirty used accessories. I got new ones eventually. Now my phone battery is worse because of that update and I need another one. My model (G960U1) doesn't get updates but the S8 (G950U1) and S7 Edge have received the update. I'm on the April update, which is a disgrace."
"Very poor recall service!  It's been almost 2 weeks since we contacted them about our broke top load washer and now they are bouncing us back and forth between Samsung and Dish (the servicer) and nobody knows what is going on. .. while I am washing clothes by hand.  It's like they are refusing to fix it, they are just passing it on to the other! I  asked them to fix it as soon as possible or send us a replacement because this is unacceptable! We have 2 little ones and a lot of laundry to do. Again,  this is unacceptable!"
"Warranty service so SLOW 21 days!!!. This is 2nd time this year washing machine (Samsung WW80J6410CW) has broken, 2 1/2 years old.  1st time took 19 days to get repaired. This time 21 days. The engineer can only inspect the machine after 10 days and then only come back 11 days later to fit the parts. I tried complaining to Samsung Cutomer Services Solutions. but they say there is nothing they can do. They finished by saying have a nice day!!"
"Wish there was a lower rating than a 1 star. Our washing machine was recalled and we were asked by Samsung to stop using the machine and get all of our clothes washed at a dry cleaners until a replacement was provided. They were extremely slow at delivering a safe replacement washing machine and when we tried to claim for the expenses the company ultimately would not provide us with a full refund. It took months of us calling Samsung and asking for the issue to get escalated before they offered us less than the amount that was promised. I have absolutely no faith in this company after all the lies, time and money they have made us waste. It's not our fault we purchased a faulty product, we thought Samsung was a trusted brand but we were wrong."
"When I went to samsung.com and bought a QLED Samsung TV it was around $500, they said the TV would arrive in 27 days, WHICH THAT TOOK FREAKING FOREVER, When I got my TV, I carefully put my TV up, the screen looked like that someone punched the screen so I turned the TV on and then it was all broken,So I went to customer support and they took about 14 days to respond, they told me that they cannot give me a refund because of their policy, so I got very upset that I could not get a refundSHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG"
"We bought a Samsung QE55Q6F QLED TV at Christmas time, we promptly discovered that it would frequently miss recordings on the inbuilt freesat, some research online will show you this is a very common fault, after many phone calls, Engineer visits and E-mails over the past 5 months we are still stuck with an expensive TV that just doesn't function as advertised, Samsung refuse to engage in any dialogue with regards to a refund despite it being under 12 month warranty and them bring unable to repair it. Their latest comment was to ask me to wait when they work on a solution (according to other customers they have been doing this since 2017)... Seems I have no option but to engage with my credit card provider to seek a resolution. Save yourself a lot of time and stress and buy from someone else"
"Certainly the worst customer experience.  800 pounds mobile handset that is within guarantee , had 3 attempts for repair and still customer services are refusing to replace it and asking to send it for the fourth time for repair. Disgusting.  All competitors are offering a much better value and service. Emailed UK.president at samsung.com Same attitude from customer (senior) representative. I have no time to take them to the ombudsemen."
"I was a great admirer of Samsung products until I had to speak to Customer Services which I can only say is the worst experience I have ever had.Samsung advertised a free sound bar if I bought a TV. So I did I purchased the TV and added the sound bar to the basket and the checkout basket showed a free sound bar.Soon after the TV arrived and a day later Samsung sent me an email advising me that the customer (MYSELF) had cancelled the order of the sound bar. This was incorrect as Samsung admitted they had cancelled the order as the advert showing the free sound bar was incorrectly displayed. Samsung refused to send me the sound bar and quickly changed the status of the sound bar to 'OUT OF STOCK'.Samsung have essentially conned the customer in buying the TV and not providing half the products as per what was clearly ADVERTISED.It's customer service operations are based outside the UK and trying to explain to them has been a major night mareSamsung admit the error but fail to compensate me for the value of the sound bar. A unethical approach and a disgrace. It is against the law to mis-advertise something, Samsung clearly do not care.A claim to the small claims court is looming.As a result I will never buy a Samsung ever again, all because Samsung did not honour something that was clearly advertised and conned the customer and failed on all customer ethical standards.SHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG."
"POOR QUALITY PRODUCT. POOR SERVICE. I wont be using them again"
"Welcome to SAMSUNG WORLD. Hello it's me. I'M HAPPY WHEN SAMSUNG STORES WILL OPENING UPDATE WITH ZAPPAHOMME STORES AT VIETNAM AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. I'm need team world business AND WHO ....!You know me ! I look to you ."
"Purchased a Galaxy watch active online from a major high street retailer because of the blood pressure and irregular heartbeat monitoring functions. On receiving the watch, I was unable to discover either of these functions on the watch or in the instruction manual. Phoned Samsung customer service who advised me that they were working on the blood pressure monitoring function and that it may be released later this year but they had no information about the irregular heartbeat monitoring.  I asked to speak to a manager but was told that this was not possible.Samsung clearly advertise both these functions on their website and appear to be willing to put customers health and possibly lives at risk in order to achieve extra sales.In addition, Samsung were offering an additional free charger to customers pre ordering this watch but the link to claim this had disappeared from their website. It appears they have received a number of complaints about this. Also golf scoring apps shown on their advertising do not appear to be available from their app store. I chose not to pursue these complaints and I had already decided in my own mind to return the watch to the retailer as not being fit for purpose.I will be reporting Samsung to Trading Standards when they open for business on Monday.The retailer in question provided an immediate refund and was highly embarrassed by Samsung's misleading advertising.I will never trust Samsung again"
"WORST support ever.Livechat is really bad.And they dont anwser email. Im very suprised at Samsung."
"I ordered this with my pre-order of Galaxy S10 Samsung.com website. On the same order the item ""Wireless Charger Pad 2018, White"" was also included. Unfortunately this item was missing from the package which was delivered. The package contained the S10 phone and ear buds which came free with the pre-order of S10. Here comes the drama. Call 1: Next morning (Tuesday) I called Samsung. They asked me to call FedEx first in case they misplaced a package. So I called FedEx. They confirmed there was just one package which was received by me.Call 2: Same morning right after calling FedEx I called Samsung again. They put me on hold for a good 15 - 20 minutes. They opened a ticked and provided me the ticket number. I was told I will be called within three business days to appraise me on the status of the ticket.Call 3: After three business days no call came. So on Friday morning I called Samsung again. This time they said it will take 3 - 5 business days to investigate the ticket and after that it will be shipped to me. I mentioned that 3 days are already passed, and asked if I need to wait 5 more days from today or two more days. The person over the phone was rude and told me that I am not listening to what he is saying.Call 4: After two business days no call came. So on Tuesday morning I called Samsung again. Again they put me hold for a good 15 - 20 minutes. Then I was told that I need to get a claim report from FedEx and also need to get a police report for the missing item. And then I need to upload that those reports on Samsung website. I said I am not going to all those as it is a hassle. So now Samsung has my money and I do not have their item."
"I ordered powerbank from official Samsung store on Dec-19, 2018. Today is Feb-26, 2019. You can count it is over 2 months and I order is even not shipped yet. I wrote to support many times but it looks like a waste of time. Some kind of robot responds the same thing: We regret to inform you that one or more items from your order #DUQKNN0B8 has been delayed for over 60 days. ... etc etc"
"IF YOU LIVE IN IRELAND please read this before buying a Samsung phone from Laptops Direct.This issue has been discussed with Samsung, their local agent in Ireland (Vodafone) and LapsTopDirect.Samsung's local agent will normally repair a Samsung phone under warranty within TWO HOURS (yes,...walk in, no appointment, go shopping, have lunch, fixed phone within 120 minutes...absolutely magic customer service or?????) unless you buy it from LapTopsDirect.co.uk.In which case, you will have to wait until the local agent (Vodafone, Grafton Street) order a part from Hungary, which can take about 5 days.LapTops Direct, to be fair have offered to take ownership of the warranty process (after a review process that can take up to 36 hours) which is what one would expect from a great retailer.But if you need your phone within two hours of it breaking under warranty you should probably buy locally in Ireland.MORE DETAILSThe phone is a Samsung S7 edge, the display has gone white. It was purchased in April 2018. It is protected by an OtterBox Strada and has never been dropped, mishandled or physically mistreated in any way. A great phone until last week. FINALLYThe phone will be fixed but it will take a week longer than a locally purchased phone would have taken, which in this day and age is not what I would have expected from a company like Samsung. This will be posted on the LapTopsDirect website and too to help potential buyers in Ireland make an informed purchasing decision."
"Myself ravi agarwal 9884232118..bought a refrigerator on 29.12.2018.it happened to be a defective product.complaint made n after fighting one n half month company accepted.they taken the defective product from my house giving me a refund coupon agreeing I can redeem the same refund coupon with dealors of Samsung across India.while we contacted dealers said such coupon they never saw and it can not be redeemed.denied..while we r suffering without refrigerator at home for last one week at home..it's a cheating by such branded company..I am helpless because company has made their contacting in such a way that no one can contact them directly..we have been harrased by the company and company staff.i also mailed them but all of them are bluffing.."
"I bought a samsumg washing machine, because I suppose samsung is a recognized brand. One month later, it is damaged. I've been requesting a guarantee for a month and a half and nobody answers. Each call gets a different excuse. (They have very well trained for this). This service is very bad, there is no kind of organization play with your time and money. I do not recommend at all the service offered by samsung, nor its appliances."
"I've bought quite a few samsung products - phones, tv, washing machine. They are all generally good products, but post sales support is hard to get.The UK website is very hard to navigate as while registering products, it jumps between 2 different systems and you can log into one at a time. So the links on the website don't work.My washing machine was delivered with 3 feet and when Currys won't do anything about it, I got Samsung to deliver an extra foot albeit after a lot of conversations and explanations."
"Bought a 48"" curved screen tv three and a half years ago. Suddenly white patches appeared either side of the picture. When we bought it we recived a 5 year free warranty with it. The shop has gone bankrupt so we contacted the insurance company. They told us straight away that they were aware what had been happening. The curved screen was a faulty one. It has been removed from sale apparantly so Samsung are aware of it.  But if you have a curved screen Samsung tv and the picture is distorted in any way get it sorted. It's withdrawn but they should have re-called it considering they are aware of it. Don't hesitate. We have purchased a Sony one with the same specifications. HD 4k. The free warranty meant we received £899 towards a new one, and we paid £55 towards it. Even without a warranty, trading standards informed me that a tv shoud last 5 years anyway and look at moneywise and your rights on the web. Get their advice. Don't forget if you paid by card you will probably be covered for this.   It is Samsung UE 48 JS 9000 TXXU ( T could be a number 7 ) Even a small well known retailer in my area agreed the after sales with Samsung is rubbish."
"Samsung has good equipments but they are pricey as hell for the quality they offer."
"Samsung customer service is the worst. I will always buy Apple products. Apple has great customer service. You get what you paid for i guess.  Samsung cannot answer a direct question & thinks the customer that is calling in is stupid. Samsung needs to invest in Americans answering the phone that understands ENGLISH!!!!"
"I purchased the preorder of the Galaxy Watch (August 10th, 2018). Thirteen days later without a notification, I had to check on the website to show that the watch got put on backorder.Samsung and false advertising that they do, on the website it still showed as ""Order by 21st ships by 24th."" It was the 24th and it didn't get shipped, but my watch straps were shipped instead (because that's gonna do any good for me).Watch was finally shipped on August 28th. Lesson learned, never order anything from Samsung because it isn't a first come, first serve."
"Avoid this company and its products at all costs! I have just learnt this the hard way after already having a terrible experience with Samsung over a decade ago when LCD’s first came out and my £1,000 Samsung TV broke 1 month out of warranty (the notorious bubbling capacitor issue), and also having a very expensive (over £1,500) Samsung laptop also break just out of warranty.I boycotted this company for a decade but in 2016 my partner persuaded me to buy a >£1,000 4K TV from this terrible company as she liked the curved screen and at the time 4K TV’s were uncommon so the options were limited, however she has just witnessed firsthand the very reason I boycotted them, our TV (which has had issues from day 1 with the TV being unresponsive to both remotes until you unplug it for 10 minutes) suddenly decided to refuse to turn on, the red power light just slowly flashes, a quick Google search for the words ‘Samsung TV not turning on+flashing red light’ brings up page after page of the same issue experienced by thousands of other very unhappy Samsung customers. Samsung’s response to my email? Try these troubleshooting steps in the TV menu’s, what sort of simpleton proposes this when you’ve clearly stated the TV won’t turn on? Then their only other comment is ‘we have no record or knowledge of this issue’... wow! What a BARE FACED LIE! They then directed me to a link for 3rd party TV repair shops, good job Samsung, ignore the fact you’re churning out products that are still breaking down within 3 years due to shockingly bad quality components then deny and lie about it.We will just take the loss and throw this Samsung garbage out, we’ve already ordered a new LG TV (in between juggling a 5 day old baby, thanks Samsung, last thing we need), thank god my partner has seen for herself what a terrible, utterly garbage company Samsung is, and she will have no problem boycotting this company now, no wonder every Samsung subsidiary on this website has such a terrible score!FYI Samsung, we also have a Panasonic TV and a Sony TV that are both older than the Samsung TV, not only are both still working fine, we’ve also never had an issue with them, maybe you can take a leaf out of their book and improve your quality, manufacturing products designed only to last a maximum of 3 years WON’T increase your sales, it will just put people off buying your products and drive them to your competitors."
"Is there a rating lower than 1 star for Samsung Customer Service?  I ordered a Galaxy watch as a Christmas gift and, taking Samsung's suggestion offered, ordered the charger to go with it.  Christmas day, it was opened and we discovered the charger was included!  13 days after that, I contacted Samsung to return the charger and was told that they would not accept it as it was delivered to me earlier than the 15 day return window.  They will make NO exceptions for Christmas presents!  While they are polite, they are immutable!  They say ""we value our customers"" but prove themselves liars through their actions.  We are building a new home and had planned on using Samsung appliances and products but, given their service and attitudes, we will NOT buy Samsung products in the future.  Thank heavens I'm only out the cost of an unneeded charger rather than major purchases!!"
"Gotta say that they do really make good TV's, I just wish that their software is a bit faster on their smart TV."
"Totally Ripped Off!Bought a fridge that was advertised with £200 cash back!  They sent a faulty fridge out to me then took offer 6weeks to get me a replacement.  By this time I had missed the deadline to make the £200 cash back claim.  Unfortunately I was unable to claim during the period of waiting as I needed to input the serial number for a product that I hadn’t yet received!Disgusting customer service from start to finish from Samsung."
"I have now called five different Samsung 800 numbers to try and find out why my American Express card has a 99 cent charge from Samsung. I do not own a Samsung phone or tablet. No one has been able to help me, and the first three people I spoke with were very, very difficult to understand. I just sent an email, so I hope that doesn't turn out to be a new sinkhole. This mind-boggling incompetence now rivals what Comcast's used to be."
"I ordered a Samsung odyssey + headset November 25th, 11/25/18. I was told the headset would ship 12/16/2018 and arrive before 12/24/18. I called multiple times since 12/16/18 to ensure it would still arrive before Christmas for I was leaving out I'd town and it is a gift for my nephew. On 12/19/2018 I was assured it would be and the tracking number might just be delayed in being sent out. I get a tracking number today 11/21/18 and it says it will be delivered 12/26. After Christmas. I called customer service. They said it was not their fault and I should have expected delays around Christmas. Infact I did expect delays and made multiple calls to ensure it was on schedule. I was insulted. Then I was actually told to call FedEx and complain to them and see if they can deliver it faster. Extremely unprofessional. Because of the fall through by Samsung to ship it in time, I asked if I could receive $10 promotional credit to spend back at Samsung. I was told it was not Samsung's fault that I only selected standard shipping. How is it not Samsungs fault for promising me a delivery time and not following through? I would have gladly paid more to ensure delivery before Christmas. After multiple attempts to talk to a higher up she said there is nothing they will do and they don't talk to customers. I was just asking for a little compensation for how upset this made me and was wanting to spend more money at Samsung. They told me they will not offer any compensation. After further attempts I was told to send and email and hope to receive a reply back from someone higher up. After this experience I may never make a purchase from Samsung again! I'm not trying to ""get something for free."" I feel I have been let down as a customer and the credit to spend at your shop would have been a nice courtesy gesture. Now I'm left with a red mark on my cheek and it is a lasting impression on my experience with Samsung. Amazon.com has never once treated me like I experienced for your customer service. They even gave a complimentary gift card of $20 for a shipping error on ups not even their side. The fact you guys completely disowned any fault in the matter is astonishing. If this is how your customer service runs I am surprised to see you still in business.Thank you for your time"
"Samsung doesn't believe in free speech. I am a veteran and fought for that right. I will not use this companies products. I am asking all my veteran brothers join me."
"Purchased Samsung 75 inch 4K UHD TV.  Picture excellent. Features very good. Sound mediocre at best (expected). User guide poor. Set-up difficult - required purchase of multiple cables & converters to connect devices. Customer service 0 No response to multiple emails."
"I ordered Samsung Phone Note 9 from Samsung Australia website on 3rd December and was assured delivery for 5th December via Startrack, on 7th December after following up several times I was informed that my phone was lost in transit and they are sending another one and I will receive it by 12th December.After chasing them on 12th dec and 13th December, I am being informed that my phone is again no where to be found.I feel like I am football between team Samsung and team Startrak, and this match is ongoing for past 10 days now.I have requested them many time for pick up from any store or from warehouse physically but this is not possible, Refund is also not an option as they have to wait for phone to come back to warehouse.My call is always answered in Philippines and no one have contacted me locally and neither they have provided me with any contact within australia and all they do is escalate the case and ask me to wait.I have purchased this phone from Samsung australia and paid Australian version and Australian stock.I have to reach out fair trading to resolve this case.I have no option to wait another 14 days for Fair trading to resolve this.Samsung Australia is no better or different than millions of website floating online for white goods.I do not expect this from SAMSUNG Australia, obv I expected more, I expected my phone to be delivered on time and not wasting my 16 hrs already on phone to resolve this.Finally after going through all this I would say Samsung is no better than any other overseas online company and we should not expect them to deliver what they promise.It is shame that such a big company can not resolve such a small issue and has been lingering on for more than 10 days now."
"I ordered the Note 9 on black Friday at a $300 off discount. My order on the website said I needed to update my payment with money well in my account. Even though I never received an email about this issue, I thought no problem, it's for security reasons. I call customer service and they said that my order looks fine and that they don't see that on their end and my phone should ship within 2 days. 10 days later I get an email saying that my order was successfully canceled. I never canceled a thing. I called customer service and they said that my payment was never received. I never received any emails or phone calls about payment issues. They told me that I can place a new order, pay full price, and call customer service back for a price adjustment. Terrible system when I called and did my part even though they didn't email me from the start."
"Great products but when things go wrong the customer service leaves allot to be desired"
"Just want to start by saying I wanted to rate 0!! This has been a shambles of an exsperince! I have had to send my Samsung off 3 times to have a screen replaced! I done everything properly, I called Samsung uk and booked the phone in though them1st time the company they sent the phone to went into liquidation and sent the phone back unfixed 2nd time the next company sent the phone back with a new screen that didn’t work at all and a cracked rear glass 3rd time managed to work out how to fix the phone, but sent the phone back loose in the special phone box. It was meant to be in a plastic seal but they just left it loose which put scuffs on the phone! There is even instruction on the box. This started around the end of October! And still isn’t sorted, I have asked for my money back, they just keep saying they are looking into it but don’t do anything, I have spoke to managers and to customer service and am now dealing with Sean ArcherPresidential Escalations Team Manager| UK & Eire. Who is also doing nothing about it! Absolute joke of a company! Never deal with them again! Going back to apple we’re the customer service is spot on!"
"We reported a faulty freezer 3 weeks ago, twice engineer out freezer went wrong after engineer replaced the motherboard.Still no replacement, been told 7-10 days for replacement.Lost contents of freezer twice, offered a very poor £50 compensation.Literally the worst company for customer service, Staff read from a script, if you ask something different from the script they leave you on hold for 20 mins. If you want good customer service DO NOT use them"

"I purchased a top of the line Samsung 4K TV in 2017 - I was superhappy with it and the performance was great.However Samsung did an update to the TV due to a deal that they did with Rakuten TV which means that the TV will start broadcasting full page ads for Rakuten TV channels and shows:* You cannot delete these channels and I had to block the IP addresses to stop them taking over the TV* Many of the ads are inappropriate for younger viewers and you find yourself diving for the remote control. It's really unacceptable to sell a premium product and then force the user to consume ads."
"My 4K TV is a beast very happy with this new achievement, thank you Samsung!"
"Purchased S9 directly from Samsung and sent in my LG for a trade in.LG in perfect condition and had 3 factory resets done, validated data wiped and no security installed prior to sending to Samsung.  Sent in 2 days after I received new phone.Samsung held on to the phone until the day after I could return the S9, then notified me that I was not getting full trade value for my LG due to it not being wiped.  Their ""proof"" is a picture of a blurry phone back with an unreadable IMEI number, then a manually entered IMEI number onto the photo.  The few digits I could make out in the photo DID NOT match my LG IMEI number.Had to call Samsung 4 times to get a person.  Chat was a joke.  Samsung rep verified for me that in the photo the IMEI was not the same as what I read to her on the phone.  I sent proof of my LG IMEI number to Samsung to dispute their findings, and that their photo does not even match their manually input data.  No response.Completely screw their customers, and unethical to boot to ensure they reject a trade in until their phone cannot be returned.  I was notified at 12:35 AM the day after I could have done a return about their bogus findings on my trade in."
"Refused to service my $600+ VR headset (which was still within the warranty period) I bought from them because it had a US model number. Even though I purchased it from within Canada from Microsoft. Customer service made zero effort to help me and was incredibly dismissive. I was hung up on multiple times while sitting on hold. Absolutely the worst customer service experience I've ever had and I will strongy rethink ever purchasing another Samsung product ever again"
"samsung find my phone website help center sucks. they are the rudest unhelpful people out there. Not only does my app not work for my $800 phone but customer service pawns it off on someone else. When I asked to speak to a supervisor they told me they didn't have supervisors and that the person I was speaking with (who gave me a fake name) told me they were the only one in charge of the phone call. I hung up and called back and could hear the guy telling his co-workers not to allow me to speak to a supervisor. He told them to say the exact words ""Im the only one in charge of this phone call"". When did customer service become non-existent. It's bad enough my phone was stolen from my favorite place to shop (costco), who wasn't very helpful, but then the people who make the phone won't even help me find the $800 phone I bought from them."
"My phone, tv, fridge, washer, and dryer are all Samsung. Nothing has shown any unnatural problems and have worked amazingly. The support is also great though rarely needed. This is my go-to brand for most electronic products."
"I would never go with the Samsung for any products. They are worst providing the quality goods. My refrigerator sucks. The service guy was impolite, and I won’t recommend them to anyone. My total money wasted."
"I have learned one thing: never buy anything from the Samsung UK. They cheat you by saying that the item is in stock, you place an order, they take the money and simply don't return it even though you cancel the order because the item is not available for delivery. In my case, it took many emails, two official complaints, threatening with court action and 14 days to get the money back. From these 14 days at least 7 days, I was paralyzed, could not do anything else than researching about the court procedures, consumer rights, ombudsman schemes, writing official demand to the credit card provider, and other relating thins. You can understand the feeling when you think about the possibility of losing £899. I am sure I will not ever visit the Samsung UK website again."
"Samsung has released two 32"" gaming monitors. One better screen very officially, and one cheaper version not so official. No journalist has written a single word about the budget version. It seems like Samsung is trying to push a budget monitor, disguised as a better monitor. Both stores and price hunter websites gets it wrong. Samsung does not publish the budget version on their website, despite both of them being recently released. Look carefully before you buy. It's about these product codes. They come in many variations: C32JG5C32JG50C32JG51C32JG52C32JG50 31.5inch 16:9 Curved 1800R 1920x1080 VA 4ms GTG 144Hz...and many more..."
"I purchased my phone from Carphone Warehouse, Unit 26 Merry Hill Centre, Brierley Hill, Dudley, DY5 1SB on 24th March 2018 for £869. In mid-June 2018 my phone started to form pink lines in the screen so I took it to Carphone Warehouse, 146-148 New Street, Birmingham, B2 4NY. There were two tech team advisors there. I explained to one of the advisors that I have not had the phone for long, as I purchased it on 24th march 2018, and now it has pink lines in it. The advisor took the phone from me and had a look at it and advised me to contact Samsung directly so that they can repair the device as it is a manufacturing fault. At that point I contacted Samsung who booked me in for a repair. Samsung sent the phone back to me and about two months later the same issue occurred so I called Samsung back and the advisor said to contact Carphone Warehouse to get a refund under the sales of goods act. I called Carphone Warehouse and they said they couldn’t do anything as Samsung had tried to repair the phone. I then contacted Samsung again and they offered me a replacement device. This took ages to get to me as in the 1st instance the driver decided to drive back to the depot without delivering the device and then the device got lost and then found and eventually after making me wait for hours on end, they decided to deliver the device. They don’t give you a time as to when they are going to deliver the device, you just have to wait in the whole day. Since I have had the device replacement, which was not long ago, the same issue has occurred. I contacted Samsung and requested for either a full refund, or half a refund or an upgrade to the Samsung note 9, to which they refused. I have contacted Samsung and Carphone Warehouse and all I am getting told is I’m sorry we can’t do anything or we can only offer you a replacement. I have given them the chance to fix the product twice and now I am completely put off the product as the replacement device I received had the same issue. I was given wrong information from both Carphone Warehouse and Samsung. Initially Carphone Warehouse should have tried to resolve the problem and if not they should have refunded my money instead of telling me to go to Samsung. Subsequently, Samsung should have advised me to go back to Carphone Warehouse before deciding to repair my device. I have all the evidence I have placed a subject access request with Samsung and am waiting for a response. As a customer I have been treated very unfairly. The journey that I have had to go through with Samsung has been ridiculous: It’s like you are talking to robots not humans. The only two people in that call centre that have been of help are Kevin and Dave, but because they don’t work for complaints they were unable to offer me a resolution.  I feel that now the issue is no longer an easy fix, no-one wants to take ownership of my problem. Samsung have had a product sold, and Carphone warehouse have had their commission, so no-one cares about my experience as a loyal customer. All this is likely to do is drive me away from Samsung as a brand, and to boycott Carphone Warehouse as a vendor. It will also prompt me to use social media, including Trustpilot, to draw attention to my plight, so that others do not fall foul of your greed and lack of customer service. Carphone Warehouse’s values state: Providing unbeatable customer service is at the heart of everything we do; Samsung’s slogan is “imagine”. I’m imaging a world where both companies care about customer service, but sadly you are both lacking."
"Email to CEO:I ordered a $5000+ TV on August 25, 2018. I have received 2 broken TVs. The second time I paid for white glove service so the TV was opened by the delivery people and it also had a cracked screen. Each time I am told I have to return the TV and and once it was in the warehouse, I would receive a refund in 7-14 days. After all this time the discounts and sales will be over. This is an unacceptable return policy. If I received a broken TV, I should be sent a new one immediately. Not refunded after 7-14 days after the warehouse receiving, forcing me to repurchase at a new rate.I am being billed by my credit company because it's been a month and I still don't have a TV. I have had to take off 2 days for delivery. Still no TV.I played by your rules and waited on the first TV. For this to happen again I should be immediately sent a TV in exchange without having to wait and reorder.I would like an even exchange and have a TV resent as soon as possible.BTW- I really don't appreciate the cookie cutter response to my (hopefully) not typical issue from the first person that answered my call yesterday before having to escalate to a supervisor."
"SCAMSUNG more like! I left my S8+ 6GB special edition in for screen repair last week monday(17/09/2018) at the Samsung Belgium main ""premium support"" center, NO ONE can find any info on my phone. Samsung Docks Brussels phone line is a fake number no one ever picks up (tried for hours without stopping a minute.) I drove 70KM and back to make sure I get best possible ""Samsung care"", it turned out to be the worst ever, having to drive hundreds of kilometers back and forth to return empty handed! They are holding my 1250€ phone and 300€ repair money hostage. +3x 140km = 50€,..  Last screen fixed (S7 Edge) with a local Samsung certified Premium partner ended up with a ""new"" broken display which they denied repairing because the repair was ""not entered into Samsung database"", while I was holding the receipt for the 300€ ""repair"" with a defective ""new"" display. Samsung really is turning into a disaster, almost a third world scam company. And worst of all, I am leaving for holiday tomorrow, so I will go back today again and if needed CALL THE POLICE until I get my phone and ""repair"" money back. These have turned into notorious scam artists over here!"
"As a long time Samsung consumer (nearly every home appliance, phone and TV in my home) I recently purchased a very expensive Samsung Wifi enabled vacuum bot. It worked (mostly properly) for less than 6 months before I had to contact Samsung customer service.  They will not replace the unit, clearly still under warrenty and the only option for repair is to wait weeks while it is shipped to them to determine if they want to fix it or not.  The cusomer service rep refused to answer simple yes or no questions and then cared not one whit that their service reviews all over the internet were 1 star.  This is the last Samsung I will ever purchase and I certainly hope word gets out, A company that treats its consumers this way and refuses to stand behind their products should not be able to stay in business."
"SUBSTANDARD GOODSI bought a microwave £219.00 from Currys. After 17 months the door has broken. The microwave works perfectly.I contacted Currys who told me it had a 12-month warranty with it. JOHN LEWIS HAS 24 MONTHSI contacted Samsung who wanted proof of everything, I sent photos. We then started on a roundabout. the pictures are blurred, we cant read the name of the retailer, we cant see a, b, c on and on it went. Their customer services crew must have got the lowest possible marks in  their Cert of Education, (one down from GCSE) I have a Samsung mobile phone in the draw that is useless. I have a TV in the garage that is uselessIWONT BE BUYING SAMSUNG AGAIN & I DONT RECOMMEND SAMSUNG"
"Unfortunately, If there was a 0 star for Samsung that would be my rating. I bought a refrigerator which is abot 3 years old. About 15 months after the purchase, the pantry tray became frozen due to some malfunction; I spent hours on the phone, and eventually got a technician to come and repair the problem wifhout a charge to me   At about 2 years the ice maker quit. Apparently there was an engineering issue (recall)with my model that had to addressed. You got it, I had to pay for the fix—$200.00. Now less than a year since the icemaker recall issue, the ice maker has quit again. While troubleshooting with custome4 serice, i was told that an expired filter would cause the ice maker to quit. When I ordered the filter which is suppose to be compatible with my model, the filter will not fit. Again, Samsung has made a minor modification to the filters that are suppose to fit my model; the change now makes the filter a no fit for my unit   They no longer make the old filters. So, again I must pay for the housing for the filter to be re-fitted to accomodate the modified filter   This company is awful. Do not buy Samsung products.  I am notifying my social media contacts about my experiences."
"I have been in contact with this company 2-3 times per week for TWO MONTHS regarding my washing machine that is broken due to a recalled part. Still don’t have the promised refund, after being told on every phone call that “it’s in the system and approved”. I am LIVID at this point. The customer service reps are rude and clueless, some put you on hold and then just leave you there until the system either hangs up the call or puts you back in line to start all over again."
"I really don't like leaving one star reviews but I recently bought a J2 Prime for a family member. I know android pretty well and was amazed to discover that Samsung have disabled most features on this phone. To the point it is unusable. You cannot use the sd card as storage in the conventional sense so the phone filled up with data in 3 days.I am so disgusted that not only can I not recommend this phone but I will never buy Samsung again as they have actually gone out of their way to make a phone less usable. Just incredible!"
"It's amazing how a huge company would try to SCAM a consumer...Samsung is world renowned for having battery issues, no denying that FACT. Unfortunately I also suffered a similar fate and the battery to my note started to swell to the point it lifted the screen and cracked the camera. I contacted them about this (along with full photos, IMEI, Serial #) and was told that the phone was out of warranty but they will repair it for free. I sent off the phone to them and after they received it, they sent me an email stating that ""after careful inspection"" (note those 3 words for later) the cost of the repair would be $506.56. I immediately sent them a message about this and provided screen shots where they said the repair would be FREE. They apologized and sent a subsequent email stating the repair would be ""free of cost"". After 7 days with no update I contacted them and was told they were still working on the phone. Another 3 days passed ... now 10 days I contacted them again and was told the same thing. That same night they sent a message saying that the cost to repair the phone would be too much and that the phone was previously opened by another technician so they'll be send it back to me as is without any repair. 1. This phone was purchased new and NEVER had any issues, falls, drops, or even scratches, so no need to ever have it repaired or checked. To further complicate their LIE... they previous email stated ""after careful inspection"" .... how do you CAREFULLY INSPECT a phone, determine the parts needing to be replaced including the inside board without mentioning the fact that it was opened before and you can't work on it. SCAM #12. They were all willing to charge me $506.56 to repair the phone at my expense, however when they realized / remembered that it was to be done for free, they kept it for a full 10 days trying to come up with a reason to avoid the repair. SCAM #2 As a side note.. I also own an LG phone ... they too are somewhat known for ""bootloop"" issues. This unfortunately happened to my device which was out of warranty. However they accepted the issue and repaired the full interior board for free. They didn't try to avoid their faults and scam consumers. I have since filed an official complaint with the Better Business Bureau and will report this to as many network & news agencies as possible. I've made sure to retain all emails and screen shots of this transaction. These large corporations need to stop taking advantage of the general consumers. WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG DEVICE!!! BIGGEST SCAM FROM A COMPANY I'VE EVER SEEN. JUST TO SAVE A LITTLE MONEY."
"Samsung were extremely quick to resolve an issue I had with a TV I purchased from a poor excuse of an online TV company. They didn’t have to resolve the problem as it was the online company who were at fault and not Samsung. I was so amazed with their customer service that I have recently bought a Samsung fridge freezer from AO.com. Yes it may have cost a little more than some other brands but it’s a great robust product. I would recommend this company to anyone and was quite shocked to see the poor reviews on Trustpilot! They must be working extremely hard to turn their reputation around."
"A lot of their products are so over-priced that any other Android manufacturer will sell the same phone with the same hardware/specs for a cheaper price.But what bugs me the most, is that Samsung phones come pre-installed with all these junk apps that not only give you ads or compromise your privacy - but you can't get rid of them!Seriously, all the junk apps are installed on a secured private/hidden partition so even if you root the device you can't uninstall it. You can disable it, but it will still occupy the same memory space.Seriously Samsung, why are you adding junk apps that bloat the phone and flood the screen with ads? And why can't we delete them?"
"I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 whit warranty. The battery's really bad. The LCD has a small broken but working normal. I did a call to Samsung and has told to send my note 8 to they would fix the battery. I sent the cell phone and after 2 days, I received the email charging me more than $200 to change the screen. I called there and said I just wanted to change the battery not lcd. They would only change the battery if you changed the screen. I thought it was absurd. I didn't need to send my cell phone for nothing.  And they're not just going to exchange the battery and send me another one along with my  note 8. I'll never have Samsung again. I thought that was very wrong.Im really injured. “ fake warranty”I going to ""APPLE"" or ""Huawei"".SAMSUNG never more. Just disrespect clients.My ticket number was 4147976846."
"My Samsung Galaxy S8 is not even a year old yet and is still under warranty. Yesterday (07/18/2018) in the morning it was working perfectly fine until I put it to charge. It got frozen on Samsung screen and was like that until the battery died. Tried to charge it, reboot it, restart it, did all trouble shooting I knew of, nothing changed. So, I went to ATT (my provider), they also tried all the things (nothing changed) and suggested to call Samsung since the phone is still under warranty. So, I did.Their Warranty policy has recently changed that I didn't know of. Now first you have to send them the device first for their technicians to check that it is device's defect and I didn't do anything to it. This takes 9 to 11 business days! 2 WEEKS without the phone!!!!The supervisor that I spoke to offered me to go to ATT and ask them for a temporary phone although this is not ATT's fault. He offered me to go to a walk in service center to have them trouble shoot my phone. There are 3 locations here where I live and all of them are about 30 minutes drive and I don't have a car...And there's nothing else they can do for me.This phone is my only access to the outside world, I don't have anything else like laptop, tablet etc. And I took better care of this phone than of myself!!!Now I'm from a different country and have no way of getting in touch with my family for who knows how long. I don't have access to my email, I can't pay my bills (now I would have to go to every single store I have a card with and pay there). I simply don't know what time it is because I don't wear a watch...I have to suffer for the unspecified period of time for something that is not my fault and SAMSUNG DOESN'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"SELL 75""TVS OF BELOW STANDARD PERFORMANCE.HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE HAVE NO INTEGRITY WITH CUSTOMER RELATIONSMAKE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS TO CUSTOMERSFAIL TO ADDRESS SERIOUS MALFUNCTIONS AND QUALITY ISSUES WITH HIGH END SAMSUNG 75"" TELEVISIONS.NO QUALITY SERVICE BREACH THE CONSUMER GUIDELINES WITH ITEMS NOT OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY .....DO NOT BUY A SAMSUNG TV ......"
"I noticed a thin black line down the middle of my fairly new tv. It was still under warranty. They requested to have a picture to show what the problem was. They confirmed it needed a new screen. This is were it gets scary. They request proof of purchase which I sent 2 weeks ago. I call to see if they received it. Customer service tells me there will be no aknowledgement.  Just wait a week. Lol. After second email still no reply. This is the most disgusting customer service ever imagineable.something so simple to resolve made difficult. Samsung has really put me off buying there things at again."
"Samsung support is completely nonexistent. I used to buy a lot of Samsung products, but now, only in the last year, I had problems with two different products, a laptop PC and a 64gb micro SD card (still in warranty), and none of them was resolved by Samsung. I won't buy anymore from this company, because it mistreats customers."
"Returned a defective phone (deadspots on screen) and it has been over 3 month and still have not received my refund.  Initially return the phone and samsung sent it back to me stating they could not accept the return because the screen was not working. That was the reason for the return!  Customer service has not been helpful they just keep saying that the return department is reviewing the return."
"The unit was decent until we found it was unknowingly leaking for potentially weeks, ruining my recently installed brand new vinyl flooring, the old underflooring, and the bottom of my units to be replaced by my insurance, because Samsung customer support is the worst. Thousands in damage, and not one response to numerous emails (to at least 3 different addresses that phone agents gave me), numerous case numbers, uploaded evidence to a claims site, many calls etc etc. I just hope my insurance take legal action against Samsung to get them to cough up for the damages.So in short, the dishwasher cost a lot, then I had to pay a significant amount to insurance deductible, and live in a building site for nearly 2 months while everything gets fixed. Great deal eh... Needless to say i'll be taking my money elsewhere for all future electronics and appliances, even out of principle, because i know appliances is a totally different dept to mobiles and tvs etc.... Will also be recommending to everyone i know to not buy this stuff either, again out of principle and the fact customer service is awful and i don't want them to get stung either.I'm also copy+pasting this to a few other sites too."
"This review is about their service/customer interaction.It doesn't seem they are a real concern.  Years ago I bought a refrigerator and I was able to get hold of them.  In the last month, I purchased a sound bar, subwoofer and speaker.  Tried to hook it up.  Need an app.  I don't have I phone or Android, so tried my computer.  Didn't work on computer as their software doesn't handle latest Apple software (I realised later).  The customer service person almost hung up the phone on me.Now I have bought a television and want to buy an accessory.  The website says the accessory may not be compatible with some models.  How do I find out?  Not on website.  Live Chat is dead, it sends a message.  No return message.  Calling and punching through the sequences, the phone rings about 5 times and go back to same menu.   Call the customer experience centre and get the message to call later as there are so many calls.  Well that's the customer experience then!How do they expect to compete with the likes of Apple?"
"Like my Galaxy S7 so far, my first Samsung phone, but it does become noticeably slower now, not sure if it is with the software or with hardware."
"My Samsung washing machine (4 yrs old) busted on the second floor, causing water damage to the entire front end of my house, both upstairs and downstairs.  In dealing with Tai W in the claims dept over the phone, she said she would be emailing me with information, and if at any time I had questions, etc, I could respond directly to her email and she would correspond.  I emailed her twice the next day with questions. It is now five days and several (sent by me) emails  later, and I have NEVER heard back from Tai.  While I am disappointed that Samsung isn't giving me back enough money to purchase the current model of the machine, I am more worked up over the fact that this is obviously an unexpected emergency I am dealing with that has tore up half of my home, and the complete lack of response from the Samsung claims representative Tai W over the last five days is beyond unacceptable.  I have no tolerance for anyone unable to show me a little compassion with this, especially when it is her job to help and interact with Samsung customers going through issues with their products.  I will not be purchasing another Samsung product so I don't have to deal with their horrible customer service again."
"Overall the phone is good but not the best. The design and display is fine. Dispaly gives you Super AMOLED screen, which offers punchy color reproduction. It adds great experience to the video. Batterylife is also good.But, the face unlock system is not good. It is very slow and sometimes not working at all.The basic sensors are bad. The auto brightness trigger doesn't work. No digital compass, so difficult to use Google Maps.If you can ignore a few disability, the phone is overall worth buying in the mid-range segment."
"I bought a new SAMSUNG 10 PHONE. They said it was WATERPROOF!! THEY HAD COMMERCIALS ON TV, THIS PHONE IS WATERPROOF! WHAT A LINE OF CRAP!! I had the phone for 1 WEEK, put my phone on a shelf in my shower which was 1 of the reasons I bought it!! I got a LITTLE wet and my phone quit working!! So I call SAMSUNG, they said it's not covered. I said ""but u said it was waterproof!!!!!!!!"" They said NONE OF OUR PHONES ARE COVERED FOR WATER DAMAGE!!   OMG!!! R U SERIOUS?!?! U  SAID IN UR COMMERCIAL IT WAS WATERPROOF!!!  They wouldnt take it back!!!! I had to pay $150.00 to get it fixed!!! I ONLY HAD IT A WEEK!!!  READ the fine print everyone!!! SAMSUNG DOES NOT BACK UP THEIR PRODUCTS OR THEIR COMMERCIALS!!!SAMSUNG ISNT THAT FALSE ADVERTISING?!?!  I'll never believe ur advertisements EVER AGAIN!!! HOPEFULLY ANYBODY READING THIS WONT EITHER!!!🤭😡🤬🤯😡🤥🤥🤥🤥😵😵😵😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"I send my super clean S7 Edge do all what they said about factory reset and send next day that I get the return box, they take 150 usd. for the trade towards the new phone, 4 month later they take 125 usd. out of my account and said that I have to do some other weird thing to the phone and that they are going to take possession of the phone for $25 dollars, we ask to charge the full price for the new phone and return the old one that we know it’s worth a lot more, they said not sorry, just stole it with white glovesNOTE: THAT WE MAKE THIS ORDER ON 01/02/2018 THEY CHARGE MY ACCOUNT 06/20/2018ONLIDE ORDER #DCP1KM0PI"
"Purchased a QLED TV and soundbar from Curry's with the offer of a £200 cash back.  The sales person told me to apply for the cash back after 30 days.  Claim Rejected by Samsung - no reason given it's a scam."
"These phones are amazing! Really big display with almost no edges. Just awesome."
"Best mobile phones and great customer support service. Had some problems with my Galaxy, everything was solved fast and they even gave me another phone, while mine was in repair. Thx guys!"
"One of the worst customer support I have ever had to deal with. If you are thinking about buying a Samsung Galaxy phone or any phone then stay away from them. Any issue with your phone means losing it for 9-14 days since you have to send it to them to get it fixed. If your phone still has problems after being fixed, then you have to send it 2 more times before you qualify for a replacement. Their support is overseas and they don't care about their customers what so ever."
"After reading positive reviews I decided to buy a Samsung Series 6 Ultra 4k LED TV on the whole it performs better than a previous TV but there are some really irritating features. For example; when you press the 'Guide' button it immediately highlights the next program on the schedule, even though the previous program may only be halfway through it's broadcast? Usually switching on your TV you are looking for what is immediately there to view, are you not? Then when you 'Exit' the 'Guide' apart from getting some annoying 'Boom' through your soundbar, it suddenly throws up another 'Menu' that I didn't want? This happens continuously, why? Are we not capable of doing it ourselves when we need to? Then if you press the 'Info' button it gives you very little info until you press the info button again, why? Can you not just give us all the info straightaway instead of doing it in installments? Then if your watching some American film with an hard to follow unintelligible dialogue you might need to use the 'Subtitles' easy to find yes, but why do we have some irritating computer generated voice talking over the film whilst your trying to implement this feature? You might say it's for visually impaired people or people who hard of hearing but I don't see how having to dialogues at the same time helps the latter. Why didn't you incorporate into the design the option to switch these things OFF!"
"Purchased a KS8000 75 inch TV last June. December 2017 we had a fault on the TV. Two vertical thick lines appeared. Screen was replaced. May 2018 same thing happened but worse then TV went dead. No power. Reported this to Samsung customer service in the Philippines. They promised a replacement, like for like a QLED model. They confirmed this with our retailer where we purchased it from. Yesterday 20th May I had a call from Samsung UK saying no replacement they will fix again. The service engineer has confirmed to Samsung and ourselves that our TV is beyond repair. They continue to treat me so badly. Failing to keep to the original agreement and all they have offered is a ridiculous 3 months extended warranty on a faulty model. The KS8000 has a common fault (Vertical lines) and has been recall by serveral retailers. I’m appalled with the treatment from Samsung, from a customer who has spent over £15k  over the years on their top range products. Never again will  I buy a Samsung product. We are now without a TV for the last seven days and not even a temporary replacement offered."
"bought mobilecare but never got it police nummer - asked samsung support so still writing with them after 2 months and getting answer we looking to your matter... they took money from bank account."
"Bought a tv less than a year ago now half off the screen is dull.Samsung said if I pay for an engineer to look at it to tell them it’s there product at fault but there’s nothing they can do.Poor company poor service"
"Purchased a new steam dryer.I have never had so much static. Clothes come out stuck together. The dog blanket, has so much static, that the dog runs around giving people electric shocks. It is crazy. I have called repeatedly, had three technicians. Apparently this is not an issue. Like really? I have an old upright dryer, 15 years old. No static. This new dryer, with steam supposed to 'reduce static'. Lol It makes it worse.I try and call them, but they wont' replace it. It is unusable, as it is basically turning all my clothes into a static filled ball. Perhaps I will get super powers.But most likely ruined clothes."
"Samsung is the multinational company to preferred electronic products.  They have made a lot of good products & I have very seldom if ever owned or used a product that they made that I had problems with or did not like. I give you guys 5 stars because you make good quality items & I hope you guys are around for years to come...."
"I really appreciate the quality of Samsung products, especially smartphones. I had had several models (including the flagships - Galaxy S), and all of them were reliable and long-lasting gadgets. In comparison, once I used Asus and Apple, and both of them led to some problems."
"I bought a new Samsung TV and the quality was quite low and we just kept running into several issues with that TV. I won't buy any of Samsung products again, not even If they're on sale. You save money at first just to spend money soon after."
"The most popular electronic company is Samsung electronics and it will be truly trust on that"
"You cannot use any cables (which is the correct type) to connect to Samsung phone to copy data out from the phone. There are trial and errors"
"Excellent product.  Works without error."
"I could write a novel, and I probably should. 1. Tripped and fell while in a rush, had 3ms old S8+ in my hand, as I landed on concrete and lightly crack the bottom of the phone. 2. FOOLISHLY didn't contact my carrier as I didn't put insurance on it. But, called Samsung. Mistake #1!3. Sent phone back. Somehow they closed the ticket, so when it arrived, it sat for 2wks, not getting repaired or sent back to me. 4. I call for updates, as I was told I was goingto be contacted to pat for the $216 screen repair. Which was fine. PS I sent it back 2/28, and was advised it was no more than a week long process. Yay! Well, WRONG! I sepnt FIFTY minutes on the phone repeating my information over and over, and 4 agents got my name, email, phone, every way to contact me, was incorrect. And I have a pretty basic name.5. Promised a new ticket was open and they'd expedite the process since I was going on a month by this point. Still no emails, no nothing.6. This in all took over NINE phone calls. Come the month mark, I get a lady, and though she was polite, she was robotic and irritating when she kept saying the same thing over and over, that they'd contacted me (mind you it was the wrong # on their end, they put it in incorrectly, not me) and then because payment wasn't received, sent my phone back!!!!!!!!!7. I FINAAAALLLY get someone who actually inputs my basic information in - Correctly! YAY! you guy did one thing right! I get the new UPS label, send it back on 3/29. They got it 4/1, and told me the next day it would be repaird and sent back to me. 8. 4/5 Ticket online shows as ""parcel received 4/5, set for repair 4/12"" are you F****** kidding me?! I have to wait for them an additional week for a phone I used for less than 90 days?! I love their products, but OMG had I known this owuld be my experice for a cracked screen, I wouldve ebay'd the parts and freaking fixed it myself and not cared if I had lost the warranty. The ironic part? Been using an iphone while it's gone. They're such horrible scumbags. 9. The ONLY good part? The last person who actually got my information in correct, heard me about to blow my gasket. And got the fee waived for repair, but that was after they initially offered 30%, and I was like, umm no. She offered me half off or free. Please do one of those, and to avoid me going ballistic, they gave it to me for free. I wish my carrier had pixels for sale, but they don't, otherwise I'd had gone to that so fast."
"I have samsung laptop and I use it for my work. Good speed and usability."
"Samsung is the best for all the reasons.AND WAAAAAAAY BETTER THAN APPLE!"
"do not but I Samsung item sent phone in for repair as screen gone funny received a to say I had to pay 265 as screen was smashed it was not smashed when I sent it and I did not pack phone it was picked up and packed by ups sent from yourself they said don't care and that's it"
"I have been with Samsung for about 10 years now. Always using the latest mobile phones by them and I've never had a problem. Some of the phones I've had, have had a few issues here and there but overall they are worth it!"
"it took long for me to concider which phone to buy, and I dont have my favorite brand but I like my samsung edge, I wish it would do less at the beggining of usage."
"Really disappointed in Samsung.  Ever since I bought my TV, several years ago, I have been able to purchase and watch my own collection of TalkTalk films without any issues - then overnight, without any warning whatsoever, the Application no longer works.  TalkTalk have stated this is a decision by Samsung who are no longer prepared to update the App on “older” TVs (my UE40H6400 was purchased in March 2015).  I have spoken to the company and, whilst very polite, the attitude seems to be one of indifference - they simply apologised for the fact that they do not intend to do anything to resolve the problem. This shows an appalling disregard for their customers. I now have a collection of films that I have purchased that I can no longer watch on my TV - and, I am more than a little angry. Other potential buyers should be aware that support for Samsung equipment may be very short-lived. Certainly, my next TV will be an LG, Sony or Philips!"
"Built in obsolescence.     I bought a Samsung external DVD drive a couple of years ago for my Window 8 laptop.  When I upgraded the laptop operating system to Window 10.  The Samsung drive stopped working.   Samsung does not provide updated driver and their technical service department did not want to know once the device is out of warranty.   Samsung is selling a mechanically identical machine with a Window 10 driver.  You cannot update the driver, you just have to buy a new one and throw a perfectly good machine away.   Madness!   No wonder we generate so much waste."
"Just bought a new tab from  John lewis. Had a problem with it and spent 40 mins talking to Samsung support, waste of my time they are useless. Don't bother with them. I have had Samsung phones for years they are good but customer service non existent. Go on the net if you have a problem. Peter Sutherland"
"Worst service. I recommend not to buy the products in Samsung. I bought a new house and address still not updated. So, I called them, they told me to give the nearest address, I gave my friend address which is 2 miles away, they accepted the order and also added a comment in the comment section. XPO delivery company which is from Union City CA came to deliver the products , they came to my house, unloaded the products into my garage and started drama saying the address is wrong and wasted time to travel 2 miles, so we will charge extra money to your account, I said no, then they loaded all the products back into their truck and simply left. When I called customer care, no one responded properly, they told me to reorder with the correct address etc."
"The service from Samsung is no doubt the worst I have ever experienced. For the last one month we are painfully experiencing an ""I don't care"" attitude by one of its service centers at Kottayam (Kerala, India) called Quality Services. Never again to Samsung !"
"I used to be a big fan of Samsung but recently I bought a Samsung J2 Prime phone. The memory was exhausted after only 7 days as there is only 8GB storage. It really isn't fit for purpose and being sold cheaply to create volume. With operating systems on phones taking up so much memory it is wise to ensure you check the memory before purchase of any phone. A bargain may not be what it seems. I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants any more than a phone to make calls only."
"Four years ago I bought a Samsung American style Fridge Freezer model type G-Series RSG5UCRS. It is a nice looking unit. After unpacking it and waiting 24hours for the ice cubes to be made we found it would not dispense any ice. I phoned Samsung and spoke to a nice lady who took all my details and arranged for an engineer to visit. He came 2 days later and found that the ice dispenser motor was already burnt out and promptly replaced it. several months later we came home one day to find everything defrosting and a pool of water in front of it. On the phone again to Samsung who again took all my details and sent out the same engineer who this time replaced a failed motherboard. Everything seemed to be fine for just over 3 years until we found out the machine was lying to us about its internal temperatures. The built in door mounted ice maker has stopped working, it has been left for 48 hours now and no ice has been produced. Also it is not showing the correct temperatures for the freezer or the refrigerator on the door panel. I have tried turning the unit off and on again at the mains supply but the problems still persist. Even after rebooting the unit it would still tell us it was at the temperatures we wanted but the thermometers I put inside told a different story. I again I called Samsung only to be told it was out of it`s warranty. But it has a 5 year warranty I argued, no they said. Because I didn`t visit a particular website, which I have since been unable to find, to register for the 5 year warranty only the basic 2 year warranty was in place. So even though I had registered it twice over the phone with faults, that did not count as registering it with them, yes they had recorded the warranty repairs but that does not mean I registered it with them for the 5 year warranty. Go figure. Anyway it still keeps thing cold and still makes ice cubes, I found the hidden reset button, so fingers crossed it keeps more or less working. Oh by the way, most of the plastic wheels have broken off the drawers so if you still want to buy this appliance don`t put anything heavy in the them."
"Their smartphones are ok but their customer care is definitely lacking a lot. Way far from Apple. Samsung sells only thanks to Android."
"Would give negative stars if I could and am thinking of hiring attorneys against them. purchased a phone and a few accessories and after a week decided to return all since I wasn't too satisfied with the phone, initiated return on website and used the provided shipping labels and on the website it only says one item has been returned so I emailed them twice and one representative says all the items are confirmed returned and another says only one is. I purchased through Samsung finance and the balance is still on there after 4 months and I have been charged substantial fees for refusing to pay for something i rightfully returned with the promise of a refund, also getting sent letters from collection agencies of possible litigation, and my credit history is being reflected very negatively because of them! I have been constantly emailing them with no help whatsoever and rudeness. This is by far the worst customer service in existence! Do not order any products off samsung website or any of their products in general since a company with such disregard for customer service is not worthy of any profit!"
"In October I bought an UHD BluRay player that should have come with 2 free discs but they were not in the box. I phoned customer services and was informed I’d have the discs within 5 working days but none arrived. Contacted them again, was told the same but nothing. I contacted customer services via twitter on 26th October to be told they’d sort it and they’d get back to me. Guess what? They never do unless I contact them first and they just give me a load of rubbish about being busy. Today, 16th December, they still have done nothing. Samsung customer service is terrible and they should be ashamed of themselves. Looking at reviews here it seems a common issue. Well I’ll never buy a Samsung product again and will do what I can to stop anyone I know from doing so."
"Ordered an SD Card over Black Friday and the shipping status was not updated until 2 weeks later, when it said it was backordered. Consumers only have 2 hour window to cancel items. After that, the customer service will state that you can only refuse the item at the door, after which you will receive a refund within 10-14 business days. Horrible."
"I bought the HW-K950 ATMOS enabled soundbar with an offer of 3 FREE UHD 4K BluRay Discs (Magnificent Seven, Deepwater Horizon and Sing). Now the soundbar is superb and I'd be a big advocate of buying one as the amazing immersive sound bubble it places you in is astonishing. But here lies the rub! The unit I bought had the three 4K discs missing. I contacted the retailer and they said the discs should be in the box as they get the whole unit delivered sealed. This wasn't a redemption offer as a sticker on the outside of the box clearly stated ""Three 4K UHD Discs in the Box"". I had previously purchased a Samsung 8500 4K Bluray Player and that came with Amazing Spider-Man 4K in the box so I assumed this would be the case too. So I rang Samsung customer support, who at first were helpful and promised the discs would be sent out in 7-10 days. 14 days later I had nothing so I called again. This time I was told it had to be escalated to Customer Relations and I'd get a call back within 72 hours. 4 days later, no call! So I called back and was given the same runaround and story. I turned to Facebook and asked on Samsung's social media site but this time I was told the offer was subject to availability and they would not supply the discs as they had run out of stock. I asked them why the bos would have a sticker on it stating that discs were inside if stock had been depleted. I got the same answer over and over again. Eventually, after 9 calls to Samsung's customer support I was put through to Customer Relations and spoke to a very blunt guy who basically told me I would not be gettint the discs and that this offer was subject to availability. Again I called them on the fact that the box had a huge sticker on it stating te discs should be inside. This was ignored and he just kept saying this was the end of this matter and I would not be getting any discs. As you can imagine I am appalled at the way Samsung have handled this and as a customer who has multiple Samsung products in the household I am gobsmacked at this con they have pulled to entice customers to buy the product but will not admit their mistake.So Samsung, you have lost a customer based on terrible customer service and misleading and misselling at point of sale. I will never buy a Samsung product again!Edit"
"Samsung products are always good but their customer service is not even satisfying .Latest is i bought a Galaxy Note 8 on 24th of this month via Samsung online shop & delivery suppose to be next day.I emailed them but didn't get response.Today is 29th, i went on live chat waited a long time when i was 1st in a queue page appears saying sorry all operators are busy,  then i called waited 37 minutes & no response so while waiting i tried live chat again & by chance i get chance to chat.The lady on the chat confirms me that tomorrow on 30th of November i am definitely getting my delivery.After an hour i received a email from Samsung saying i can not receive my order before 5th of December as they are busy.If they are busy it's not my problem as they advertised on the web next day delivery but taking 11 days."
"Gear s3. Don t buy it. Gps inaccurate. Battery life poor. Heart rate poor. Poor aps. Shame ut looks loveky but as a health/ fitness aid its useless. Dosnt do what it says on the tin. Its titalky fakse advertising. And wgats worse After sales support non existent either. They are clueless. They were supposed to arrange collection if my faulty device...although on web I can see it's just the product (seems everyone has this issue)...After dozens of emails they ate incapable to e an arrange collection. After 2 weeks of no help I get told to arrange collection myself...haha wish I stuck to Garmin. I've had to go back to a Garmin forerunner I bought back in 2010 to track my road running. Its more reliableand accurate than the s3...how embarrassing is that for Samsung...and they do t even care ! I have always bought samsung stuff. They used to be quality. Them days are over."
"Faulty American style fridge freezer, model no:RSA1SHPN, now 4 years old, (warranty 2 years only) faulty water evaporator coil (as mentioned on a similar model on watchdog, see YouTube for details) also large cracks to rear lining inside fridge (defrost heater?) at present fobbed off with the same excuse that outside of warranty, Samsung seem to not realise or follow the sale of goods act 1979 and realise items such as this are expected to last a reasonable amount of time (under 6 years by law)Legal action may be the only recourse if not satisfactorily resolved.I would expect better from a company like this"
"I own a plethora of Samsung products including, Samsung S7 Edge, Samsung S8+, Samsung 10.1 Tablet S, Samsung Gear, Samsung Gear S3 Watch and lots of others.Brilliant products, great company, good support the one time i've had to use it. Keep up the good work Samsung!"
"several months back I bought samsung SSD 256 gb evo. Works very good."
"Long story but a good one, I'll be as brief as possible.  My Samsung tab a 10.1 backlight stopped working 2 months in, under warranty so i sent in for repair. They sent me back a different tablet, tab a 8 inch.  I call right away, seems they don't believe me, doing constant receipt and item number checks that take forever with emails and multiple calls.  2 weeks go by i send in wrong tablet. They asked me to track it and when it gets to Samsung to call them again so i do. Stil have not found mine.  Now a month has gone by and still nothing.  At this point I request a new one or my money back and they cannot do either they still think they can find it.  I asked them about my 132gb memory card that i bought.. sorry sir nothing we can do, we guarantee wipe all tablets clean before sending back so you lost all your data.. ""sorry no one told you that."" Well that was a lie because all the sudden (a month later, google is showing my tablet in use by another person.  With everything on my Google saved with auto fill thet have access to all my personal accounts and actually made purchases with my ebay and Amazon account! Not only that but they also manufactured a way to delete all my Google Docs and sheets that had hours upon hours of work.  After this I gave them a chance to make it right in my mind.. send me an upgrade of the s3 and I will still stick with samsung products for all my products  (chrome book, s7edge, and s3 watch).  Their policy doesn't covet any of what happened and there is nothing they can do but now still find my tablet.  16 hours plus of phone time, and recovering fraud charges on my accounts and changing all passwords. What a nightmare! And they did nothing!! Month and half later did get tablet back but Samsung will not get me back.  If Samsung sees this I'll give them one last chance if they can make this right."
"never had any problem with samsung devices."
"Really bad customer service. Ordered tv from samsung.com and it was sent broken with a cracked screeen.  Been iver two weeks, no return labels sent, no refund. This place is not good for just service. For a company of this size I find their service appalling. Disappointed and never buying samsung again."
"The worse customer service ever. Will never use again."
"I am a samsung s7 owner. I saw the website that I can trade in my old s7 to s8. I tried the application, my s7 is like new no scratch or whatsoever. Retail price of s8 is £533.00 and if I tade my phone in it will cost me the same amount of £533.00. So it means they will take your phone for free. WHAT A SCAM!How this company rob their customer. I whope there is a problem again with s8 I wish it will explode this time."
"I ave been using Samsung Note 3, though the phone is a bit old now but I am still in love with it. it 4 years it never got hanged. Now I am trying to buy latest model of Samsung Note but still gonna keep my old mate with me.Hats off."
"worst customer support ever , unable to fix appliance and want help or replace"
"worst customer service ever in my whole lifetime. I have to wait 2 hours to be able to talk to some one and the information they provide is not correct and keep getting transferred from one department to another in circles and no way to get any help. Samsung.com website to purchase products is another disaster. The price displayed in the descriptions or other areas does not match the price in the cart. Absolutely no way to get any kind of support.I spent almost 2 days trying to talk to someone who can help and everytime, I get transferred with no resolution."
"Very happy with my Samsung Galaxy S6, I've had it for over 2 years and not felt the need to replace it as yet, although the battery is getting a little tired, other than that I am very happy."
"Samsung makes the best televisions for my taste. I love the colors and quality of the picture. The menu and the side features on their TVs are the best in my opinion."
"Their website is not the easiest website to purchase things off of. Not to mention they have no idea why people pre-order things. I pre-ordered the Note 8 expecting it to be delivered to my house on the day of release ( kind of why people pre-order things) and I am not receiving it until 3 days after the release. Their customer service is an absolute joke. Not to mention Rice badge number 126 is incredibly rude and will cut you off mid-sentence and not even apologize for it."
"They give apple the competition needed though I think they are not as good. My husband thinks otherwise"
"Samsung is really something, I am user of samsung products ( TV, Phone ) for a years, never had any trouble with it, works very fine."
"I love Samsung and always have. The android platform is easy for developers to build apps on, the designs superb, slick and always cool. This company will bounce back from the exploding note 7.  All tech companies has set backs, Microsoft OS that threw the blue screen of death at the product demonstration back then and others."
"Samsung s7 is so good. I have enjoyed it to the max. FAr better than the Nexus phones I have been using before. I hope it will maintain a high level of performance for a long period"
"I have been using Samsung galaxy S8 Plus for an year now and I am pretty impressed by its power lasting quality. What I am really grateful about is their excessive storage and camera quality, JUST WHAT I NEEDED!!Actually, my best friend gifted me on my birthday he bought it from telemart Pakistan.I thanks Samsung for great smartphone and telemart Pakistan for the best quality product."
"customer service SUCKS!!  Their products SUCK!! Told me I was getting a refund on my washer from hell 2 months ago and I sent in the information and they said it was approved NOW they need more information and no one answers the number they gave me..they call from that number and when I answer no one is there and when you call back they say they are closed and open 2-5pm...I can't get a straight answer about who's calling from that number and they tried to say that is not from Samsung..1-888-501-2502 is a Samsung number. Sick and tired of the run a round for the past 4 months!!!"
"Smart TV arrived damaged in shipment.  Immediately called and requested return label.  That was May 22.  After numerous phone calls and multiple emails, still no return label.  Customer Service informed me over the phone that they were unable to contact returns to determine what the delay was.  ended up sending another request for the return address label, and same thing - no response, no label, no explanation.  I have been shopping online for years - they are easily the worst customer service I have ever encountered."
"We bought a Samsung washing machine a few years ago. We loved it and it worked great. A couple months ago we got a recall notice in the mail that said the machine had an issue that might cause excessive vibrations which could result in damage or injury. We were given two options a small credit towards a new machine or to have them repair the defect. We chose the repair option.Immediately preceding the first repair the machine stopped working. After putting a load in and setting the options it would start the wash but never finish. It keeps draining the filling the tub with water again over and over. It wastes unacceptable amounts of water and electricity and doesn’t even wash the clothes. I’ve called support countless times and each time they say the same thing. They’ll send a service repairman out for the issue. We’ve cleared our schedule and made arrangements three times for a repair man. Each time they come out and say that it has been fixed and should work. After the third failed repair I called and they wanted to schedule another (fourth) repair. I told the customer service rep that this was unacceptable and I wanted the credit or a replacement. She opened an Executive Customer Relations ticket and told me someone from that ECR would contact me in 48 business hours.  A week goes by and I don’t receive any call. Yesterday we tried small load of towels on low spin setting. The machine ran so long that it drained all the hot water in the house, in the middle of my kids bath. He had to finish his bath with cold water. I call today and speak with Torri at ECR and she tells me the same story, yet another service call must be made. This time she will instruct them to call Samsung during, as if somehow that will make a difference. If you google Samsung top loader recall, you will find thousands of articles, videos, news reports, and even pending class action law suits. Samsung, you can’t treat your consumers like this. You made a defective product; you should stand behind it and make it right."
"bought an highend samsung tv. lots of money. only work for 3 weeks. samsung try to replace twice. (took more than 6 weeks.) finally, samsung said they will need to replace it and give me a number 888-501-2502, which the answer machine said their work hours is 2pm-5pm. (?) . try to call that number 2 days, only get busy signal. try to call back customer service (800), they put me in wait queue and never answer. about to call consumer protection."
"It's a shock to learn SAMSUNG cannot provide spare part saying for its products if it's over 7 yrs , what am I expected to do now ,every time I look at it , I feel ashamed of myself that I chose SAMSUNG over others , which as per SAMAUNG their products will not work or sue motto die after 7 yrs of its life, why was I not told during purchase about this ,WHAT THE HELL WILL I DO with a redundant prodout !!"
"I own a Samsung galaxy tablet 9.7 E and a S7 EDGE and am very happy with the performance as I have been happy with Samsung products since I started using them about six years ago. In my opinion Samsung and Apple are the top brands when it comes to Phones, computers, tablets etc. Each brand is different for good reasons and everyone has their preferences mine happens to be Samsung of course ."
"We bought a Samsung laptop that turned out to be the worst machine we've ever used.  Continual crashes, screen did not dock or connect properly to the keyboard, and Samsung customer services couldn't give a damn.  With their phones bursting into flames around the world and a list of other company disasters, it's a wonder they are still in business.  We've had such bad experiences of Samsung products we've now decided to boycott Samsung for life."
"Terrible customer servers working at samsung estore!(Norwegian department) And this comes from a person who mostly love all kind of people. After 3 days with my new samsung gs8 I started to stop. After 6(!) phone calls, where they were telling me to call the same number - which didnt work(!) They finally told me that I should send it back and get a new one. When I asked them about how long it would take for me to receive a new one, they said a couple of days. The days went by and I called them again to ask how long it would take. I was then told to wait one week more. When I told the phoner, that I didnt wanted to receive it then, he told me that I had to. I asked him if the phone was sent, and he said no. Again I asked him why I had to recieve it then, he said that that was how their procedure are. I also explained him that I couldnt wait that long because I had to go on a holiday - there were no signs of understanding from him. He was rude! I called them up again and one of his colleagues told me that he would try to take care of it, and call me a couple of days after. I never heard ANYTHING from them. Over a week after when I came home from my holiday I had recieved a packet with the new phone. I once again, no actually 10times again tried to call samsung, but their button services is still not working as it should. After talking with the one rude person after the other rude person (do you think that these people should represent samsung after all what the samsung company has been through?) Finally I was told to pick up the phone, call them again and make a return. I confirmed with the phoner, that this was what I had to do. When I picked it up, I called them again as I was told. The rude phoner then told me to wait for a call, because the guy handling the returns had went home for the day. I asked him about when he would call me, and he couldnt tell me. I asked him if I didnt call the return department, and he said yes but that I had to wait for the call from his colleague. When I wanted to ask him another question, he got mad and stated for me that I had to wait for the call. He talked to me like if I was his child. I wouldnt recommend anyone buying samsungs electronics online, as their phoners are so extreme rude! Definitely a waste of time, energy, money and good mood. I sincerely hope that I will receive a call tomorrow, so that I can make the return, and never talk to these rude phoners again in my life."
"My sister used Samsung Washer which turned into a considerable product. Taking this trust ahead, our kids purchased more products from Samsung, like their AC and mobile phones.They turned into the worst products that we have ever used. Services just pathetic. A major no to Samsung products."
"horrible service .I've been waiting for a order since April 22nd .i call and i get no help.they tell me my order is pending fulfillment .one lady even hung up because i asked for an supervisor"
"I just bought a Samsung Galaxy S7 which was supposed to come with en e-certificate. I had to call thrice to get the certificate. Customer service experience is horrible. Every time, I was on hold for 30 to 50 minutes before I got to talk to a rep.After I received the certificate, I wanted to place an order. I wanted two items and one was out of stock. I went ahead placed the order for one item thinking that I will be able to use $100 towards the second item once it was available.  I didn't realize that it was a one time use code. It was in the fine print. To some extent it is my fault but I feel that this is a horrible practice by the company which amounts to may be fraud. If they really wanted to take care of the clients, they will be upfront about the terms of the certificate.After talking to various reps today, they didn't want to restore the balance. I am never buying Samsung products again. The customer service is difficult to get to and they all just parrot company policy."
"Samsung are pretty good. I've had trouble with their phones in the past so I no longer buy them but I still use their computer screens. Great screens and have lasted me a long time"
"Very poor and very slow customer service."
"First off, customer service will take your call between 45 minutes to an hour. Had to return a phone with immediate lag right out of the box. Still have yet to receive the rma paperwork. I should have trusted myself and my inner instincts telling me to avoid their phones, but I was swept up in the marketing. Big mistake."
"I love Samsung been dealing with them for years, just got the Samsung Shop app for my galaxy phone, and just ordered thousands of dollars of electronics!! Can't  wait til they arrive.  GOD BLESS!"
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Let's start with how accessible their customer support is. First do NOT expect to reach anyone until after you have been on hold for 2 hours. You cannot even use their chat support. Bottomline they do not have enough reps to sustain a reasonable support first call time. Next let's talk about how their associates are pretty much robots. Not very smart ones. I called to update my address for the GEAR VR promo as I pre-ordered my S8. I went through my address 3 times with the rep and he even read it back to me. Fast forward to delivery day and FedEx tells me that they don't have an apt number. Remember I have gone through this with someone weeks before. FedEx has an agreement where the shipper is the only one who can make any edits or even allow someone to come and pick up their item. I get that considering what the item is. I reached out via social media on both Twitter and Facebook. I got NO RESPONSE on Twitter, but on Facebook someone was able to get back to me and said to private message with more info. My post was clear about what happened, but I was still told to private message them just to be told that I need to call a Samsung number. I just called and they told me that I need to call another number. They gave me a number with a voicemail that said I should call another number. Well that number sent me to another call tree saying I needed to call a different number with the request that I had. I am now in an endless loop of bureaucratic nonsense. It's not worth it. You will end up wasting away your life with hours spent trying to resolve their mistakes. Worst experience ever!"
"I've owned the following products from Samsung, all of which have either failed, required repair or some interaction with customer support:Samsung DVD/Blu-Ray player - would fail to read any disc and required sending the entire unit back to the mfgrSamsung 60"" LED TV - would not turn on after about 9 months of use, would just get 3 blinking lights on the indicator; they sent our repairmen who took the TV apart and replaced a circuit board that fixed the issue - no cost to me but a hassle to deal withSamsung 40"" LED TV - the LED backlit display flickers or loses it's brightness by about 70% randomly; restarting does not resolve the issueSamsung Refrigerator w/French Doors and Drawer - issue with compressor noise and ice melting in lower freezer compartmentTheir customer support seems to be overwhelmed with service support calls so they are very slow. They do tend to respond and make an honest attempt to resolve, but I cannot give a solid rating to a company that starts with a poorly made product in the first place.  I am slowly phasing out Samsung products from my household.  They win you over with reasonable prices, good features, and nice looking products.  The quality has gone down."
"phone starts malfunctioning when connected to wi-fi. have to typein IP manually and it disconnects every time. no such issue with other phones and same wi-fi provider or modem."
"Have had television from Samsung. Wouldn't go to 3D, so phoned Samsung, to be told that they wouldn't replace it. We had to have their engineers out 3 times. Like a fool, my husband ordered a microwave from them. This kept blowing a fuse. Once again engineers came out, but couldn't find the fault. Because their engineers couldn't find the fault, they wanted to charge me £50. Needless to say, I refused to pay it. In the end I scrapped the microwave, because I was so frustrated with the service I got. No more Samsung in this house."
"Bought wireless charger off Groupon, not even 6months later the charger quit working. Asked for a refund didn't like the whole wireless charger idea and then really demised the charger after it quit working. All Samsung offered was a exchange"
"Very quite, dries the clothes very quickly  I think because of spin cycle on washer gets out much more water than older models"
"1200 quid tv, black spots on the screen after light use .remote died quickly but was replaced.., it had a 5 yr guarantee by currys which they didnt send me.had to complain to head office who took ages but found the paperwork ( repair was then quick and good),however the currys saleswoman  lied to about tv functions, i took this up with currys and samsung. Both ignored me. The voice app is still not working correctly but i gave up on that.The tv for what is was is too dear and samsungs messed me about. LG next time as before"
"Washing machine developed a fault, phoned the helpline that naturally asked further questions to try and establish the problem or whether an engineer required. Then the service becomes appalling, they promise to phone you back and don't, you phone back in and they have no record of previous calls. You repeat the process and get told they will call back the cycle continues 2,3,4,5,6 times and counting. Shocking service for a big company. Once I did finally talk to an agent that seemed to give a monkeys, a repair company was booked who did a great job. The whole process to get to that stage was far too stressful and took far too long I shall never recommend a Samsung product as a result. I then received a questionnaire to complete on the repair company's service, yet they didn't want to know about their own helpline. Returned 5 stars for the third party and added a zero for Samsung. Based on their review score on here, I guess they don't care..."
"I still don't like the way Samsung dealt with the Galaxy Note 7 disaster.I understand that these things happen....... but how can we trust them if they send out updates to brick peoples phones. Will they carry on like this if another phone doesn't meet their expectations??A company shouldn't have that kind of power at their disposal.Also, they didn't make return policies clear enough through mobile providers.Terrible"
"I ordered a CF791 34 inch Computer monitor from Samsung.com and had the following issues- Did not receive an order confirmation immediately ( Their system allows for up to 72 hours to send out a confirmation e-mail ) - Order confirmations should be sent immediately no exception.- Called up support after not receiving said offer confirmation and they couldn't find my order and opened a ticket- Order confirmation came at 1:30am the following day- Customer support contacted me the next day telling me my Samsung gear was back ordered and would not ship until March. ( Note - I did not order a Samsung gear )- Follow up customer support correctly identifies the product I ordered, but regrets to inform me that the product is back ordered a and I won't receive it until March. Upon asking why I was allowed to order it, the CSR told me their system doesn't alert customers to out of stock items- A few days later I get a shipping confirmation.  What?!  Yes, my monitor is shipped and is arriving net week.  Yay the nightmare is over... Or has it just begun.- Monitor arrives. Unpacked and setup.  It's beautiful.... Amazing. Turn it off and go to bed.- Morning.  It doesn't power on.  No LED activity. Unplug replug reconnect different outlet.  You name it I tried it.- Call customer support.- They tell me they can ship me a new power cord.  I tell them that's probably not the issue as it had powered up so it had been receiving power.  - CSR says I will have to send them the monitor to repair. To which I refuse and want a full replacement.  The monitor is busted, they can sell it refurbished when they fix it.- CSR quite abruptly sends me over to Customer Sales Support.- CSS rep informs me I will have to send the monitor in for a refund and then I can order a new one.  Excuse me?!  Not acceptable.- I've already had a horrible customer experience and now they want me to do it ALL over again?- Ask to speak to their supervisor.  Hoping cooler heads will prevail and we can get this sorted out.- He just re-iterates what the first CSS rep says.  They can only ""e-mail"" me a return label in 3-5 days and I will have to re-purchase the item.- Why, WHY does it take 3-5 days to ""e-mail"" a return label? Amazon and most online web stores can generate a return label immediately for you.- Amazon will also send you a replacement even before they receive the return- Samsung can't process a SIMPLE replacement, they don't have the process in place- Finally to pour salt in the wound, the serial # is not associated with my order so I need to read him it off the back of the monitor. Come on guys get it together.;TLDR Never under any circumstances order from Samsung.com.  Buy through amazon or Best Buy or a reputable online retailer."
"Samsung ice makers are notorious for failing soon after purchase and for the lifetime of the product. We bought our Samsung Side by Side April 2010,  Model Number: RSG257AARS/XAATwo weeks after we bought it the ice maker began to only shoot out a few ice cubes a day. We called Samsung. They sent out a repairman and he replaced the ice maker. It lasted till just after the warranty went out and failed again. To make a long story short, in the past 6 years I have had to replace 4 more ice makers out of my own pocket. May of 2015 I replaced the last ice maker but this time it made no ice at all. I called out a repairman, he said it was the motherboard according to the diagnostics from the Samsung troubleshooting codes, and then he ""hard"" tested it with his multimeter and confirmed that the heater part of the motherboard was out. So he replaced the motherboard. It worked after that until the end of September and stopped again. I called the repairman and he said he would check with Samsung's tech department and get back with me. He never did despite me texting him and leaving messages for him. Still haven't heard from him as of today 1/14/2017. I called Samsung again and after running through their worthless-time-consumming-troubleshooting-procedure, they said they would send out a certified Samsung repair person. The night before that repair person was to show up, he had his secretary call me and ask me if I still wanted to have them come out the next day but wanted me to know it would cost $160 just for him to make the trip and then there would be time, labor, and parts in addition. In looking on the internet at Samsung reviews, for years the pages have been filled with complaints about Samsung ice makers. Why has our government not done anything to force them to recall or make good on these ice maker issues. There are people on the net that bought their Samsung items just a few days before Christmas and are already having their ice makers to go out.Don't buy Samsung anything. Always problems with cell phones (batteries), tablets (fires), ice makers, refrigerators, dishwashers (Control panels and mother boards) - you name it. They don't have any product that works like its supposed to.We either need the feds to do something with them or a class action lawsuit or something. They are definitely a RIPPOFF!"
"Bad very very bad company and they service!!! Two months ago we bought Samsung American fridge its stops working all ready, we went to the shop where we bought (PC world) they said we need to contact to Samsung company, We contact with them 3 times they keep saying same thing and they not doing anything, we waiting 4 days all ready no  respond from them.They don't care about the customer at all!!!!!  I would never recommend to buy anything from them!!!"
"Just bought the S7. What an amazing phone! It's simply the best device I've ever had, it's superfast and takes amazing pictures. Very satisfied!"
"I chose to by directly from Samsung.com, because I preferred to pay a little extra to be sure that I wouldn't have any problems... I was wrong. I would recommend that Samsung close their webshop, since the many angry customers must affect their overall marked share.This is my experience:Nov. 27: (Cyber Monday) Order placed - ETA 1-3 days (Estimated Time of Arrival)Dec. 12: Back order - no ETADec. 22: ETA Jan 22.Jan. 21: ETA Jan 21 (same day)Jan. 21: ETA changed to Feb 21,Jan. 29: I wrote a mail with the subject ""Cancel order"" including the sentence ""Cancel my order""Jan. 30: Answer from Customer support: ""We appologize... extended back order"" ... ""Please advise if you are wanting to cancel or continue with the order."" - If they had read the previous mail, they shouldn't ask me this question.- Considering the mail a few hours later (see below), I conclude that they haven't put much effort in researching the ""extended back order.""Jan. 30: I clarified that I wanted to cancel the order.Jan. 30: Samsung confirmed that they had just shipped my order.Jan. 30: I ordered Samsung to NOT charge me, and clean up the mess themselves since they had already spoiled my Cyber Monday and Christmas.Jan. 31: Samsung confirmed that they had charged me, and said that only the customer could contact the shipping company to cancel the shipment. (This is wrong - but saves Samsung for the work)Jan 31: I called the shipping company to cancel the shipment. The shipping company confirmed, that Samsung was fully able to cancel the shipment as well...Remarks:- I gave Samsung the opportunity to ship a similar product in stock - they refused.- Most of the back order mails does not have an estimated in stock, when they do, it's always accidentally  one month from the day of the estimate. In addition the customer service ""research"" confirmed an extended back order just hours before they sent the package.I will edit this review (and rating), if Samsung manage to compensate me for the mess they have done..."
"Ordered the new gear watch December 6 and was told when I ordered it would ship January 31. It didn't. Was given a further date of March. Decided that was too late to give a Christmas present and cancelled the shipment. 3 days later, it shipped anyways regardless of my cancellation. I refused shipment and it was returned to the warehouse a month ago. I was promised by about 20 different representatives that I would be refunded. I called and called, every few days. No answers. One person LIED to me and said I never sent my product back; however, I have an email confirmation from Fedex saying it was signed for at Samsung. Samsung kept the watch and my $400. PayPal opened a claim against them and Samsung never responded to it. They are thieves. Never again will I spend another cent on any product by them. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"Bought a Samsung smart TVs to use for watching Netflix only to find that it was missing off the Smart Hub - their version of App Store.  I messaged their customer service (facebook) several times asking where to get it.  They asked for lots of info, which I sent.  They then came back suggesting I contact the app developer to ask when the Netflix app is coming out.  Further messages just prompted further 'can't be assed' responses.  One vaguely friendly response said to message them if I had more issues, when they hadn't even solved the original one.  It was a bit like buying a new car, from a dealer, and when it broke down being told to take it back to the factory.Won't be buying any more Samsung products!"
"7day before i purchased a LED TV and after 2 days i got white screen, when i raised a complained they told the technician will come and fix it in 24-48hr but i am still waiting for him."
"I purchased a Samsung Washing Bubble for about £400 as it came with 5 years part and labour.  After one year it broke down and I phoned customer services who were very poor in dealing with the problem.  After 3 visits from the engineer and 3-4 weeks later it is finally working again.So I was without a washing machine and had to pay to have my laundry washed.  I contacted the CEO and the lady who replied to me was very unsympathetic and simply apologised.  No gesture of good will was offered at all.  WOW!!! I was shocked! I didn't realise Samsung had such poor customer services!!"
"Terrible customer service! I called two weeks ago to report a problem with my Smart TV not connecting to the WiFi. After about a 30 minutes conversation with no resolution, the CSR confirmed my phone number and told me he would call me back once he did some more research to my issue. Of course he never called back...I called again tonight and talked to a very incompetent CSR. His only idea was to factory reset my TV which made the problem worse and caused another problem. He then told me to call my ISP because he couldn't help anymore. Problem is that the problem he caused by resetting the TV will not allow for any support from my ISP as the network settings and network support menus time out and 'close out' before I can do anything. CSR rep just told me he would send out a Samsung service tech and of course I would be charged for it.Terrible company with terrible support. Will never buy another Samsung product due to their lack of care and help with issues."
"On boxing day, I found Samsung galaxy S6 was on excellent discount. I wanted to gift my wife. I bought it immediately. got a confirmation mail, saying the transaction in progress. After two days, I spoke to customer service and they said, it will be dispatched on the same day. After days (status still showing in progress), I spoke to customer service again. this time, I was told the items is not warehouse, and I was advised to cancel my purchase. I was ready to wait, the reply was, you will not get it. I was surprised, I am not talking to some XYZ company. they are makers of Samsung product, if they don't have clue when they will get their product who else will know. because of this confusion, I missed other valuable sales. Never again Samsung, thank you"
"I spent over $550 on a brand new Galaxy S2 10"" tablet... Out of the box, it had/has a blown out/stuck pixel. It's bright green! Right in the of the screen. They won't replace it. I had/have to go through this big production of resetting, backing up, hold this button while holding that button....   And now, I have to print out a label ship it to them to ""fix"". I basically bought garbage for $550 and they WILL NOT stand behind their product...  Awful, awful, awful... STAY AWAY. Don't even get me started on the ""off shore"" agents with thick Philippino accents"
"I dont understand how can they expect us to use their technical products, when they cant handle their online website. Samsung.com takes orders but never ship.. one of the worst customer experience. Its very easy, if you dont have item in stock then either say backordered or don't accept the order, is that difficult ???"
"I purchased a samsung tablet from amazon. 3 months after the charger brokeemailed samsung took 2 day's to respond and another email after a week I get a phone call to say they are sending me  a new chargerNow a month later hasn't arrived Phoned samsung they don't communicate with there online email Support  might as well be 2 different companies Tried 1 more time by phone seemed like  I was wasting my  time"
"email from samsung We can see from our records that an order attempt was made on shop.samsung.com.Due to an unexpected interruption the order has not been completed. It would appear the information went through the website and our payment processing gate, but wasn't accepted in our order management system.This is nothing to worry about it could simply be bandwidth or a browser setting.This email is to confirm that we have cancelled any information from our system and we would like to invite you to retry in the next 60 mins.Please let us know if we can further assist.Kind Regards,AlexSamsung Shop Support Team 	Alexander Stoyanov (Samsung Shop)Dec 13, 09:29 GMTDear  Thank you for your other patience.Unfortunately the time period for the Black Friday offers cannot be extended.

Alexander Stoyanov (Samsung Shop)Dec 15, 09:05 GMTDear Thank you for your reply.The price has not been raised by our team, a relevant department decides on prices.The mistake is an IT issue, again not our fault.We have not charged you, just pre-authorized the funds, and when the transaction expires, the money is returned to you.Kind Regards,AlexSamsung Shop Support Team."
"Brought a TV which was delivered with missing bolts to contect the stand. Made to jump through ridiculous hoops to verify my purchase to begin the wait for these parts. If only Samsung were as thorough in the packing of new products as they are in the control of the distribution of spare parts (that I imagine cost £1 at most). Not at all what I'd expect after spending nearly £2,000 on a new TV that I was once excited about before all this unnecessary hassle wore me down and ruined something that was supposed to be fun."
"Been dealing with customer service since black Friday because the small company I supported in my community with the purchase of 2 Samsung Galaxy 7's uses carbon copy hand written receipts and they won't accept them for the purchase of the phones to get the free VR Gear.  They said they would send me another email so I could resubmit the receipts, but of course to no avail I still haven't received them.  This was the only reason we purchased the phones was because of the promotion.  Don't waste your time with Samsung their customer service team isn't professional and they really don't care."
"I needed a new screen replacement, so went to Reading store and asked for a quotation. They said I had to book the phone in and after about five hours a technician would contact me and give me a quotation. I don't live in Reading so just asked for a price. That's when we started a guessing game. Here's how it went; I said about £100. He said maybe higher. I said, Okay, between £100 and £150. He said, maybe higher. I asked him to tell me how much. He said he couldn't tell me. I carried on and said, Okay, between £150 and £200. He said probably but I had to check it in first. I walked away. I hope he enjoyed the game. Well done Samsung Directors on providing your staff with such an entertaining response to customers who pay your salary!"
"Not sure why my post was deleted on Facebook but reposting:So I have previously posted my concern and nobody has contacted me despite numerous promises. I have now contacted the CEO of Samsung UK on Friday and (surprise surprise) still waiting to hear back but in case he has missed it, here is the email below: -------------------------------------------------- Dear Mr Sang Ho Jo (s.jo(at)samsung.com) First of apologies for making direct contact to yourself but I have been unable to resolve my concerns having previously contact your customer service team on several occasions.  I first reported my Microwave had stopped working about 4 weeks ago and arrange for a Engineer to visit on the 4th November. They confirmed that the Microwave was at fault and 2 parts needed to be ordered and should be resolved in the next 5 days.  Since then I have not been contacted by Samsung so decided to chase a response on the 10th November and had my concern escalated to the Customer Service Priority department. I was promised a call back on the following day which did not happen so made contact on Friday 11th November and was told that I would be contacted before 18.00 that day. Again nobody contacted me. I then contact Samsung again on Tuesday 15th November and was told somebody would call me back with an update and again no body contacted me. I attempted to contact Samsung for the final time on Thursday 17th November and was put on hold for over 10 minutes and then got cut off and nobody has attempted to contact me since. Despite daily phone calls on my part I am yet to get an update on when my oven will be replaced, refunded or when the spare parts that are required will arrive. The microwave has been in use for less than 3 months and no longer works. I have been a Samsung customer for a number of other electronic items and have never needed to contact the customer service team but on the first occasion of having to report a faulty item I am genuinely disappointed with the lack of care, attention and service that I have experienced. Can you advise if it is normal process and part of Samsung customer service policy for the customer to constantly chase updates? If this is the case then as ever I again request can you please give me an update? My case number is xxxxxxxx  Address: xxxxxxxxxxxx I am more than happy to discuss this with yourself. I can be contacted on xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Kind regards"
"Unbelievable. I am just speechless. I purchased a TV from Samsung.com, and the customer representative and the website explicitly said that the item will ship within 1-3 business days. Next thing you know, they say you can't find your order. Next thing you know, they're backordered. Next thing you know, it'll ship tomorrow. Next thing you know, oops they screwed up and it's actually shipping 10 days later. Next thing you know, it might not ship a month later. All while floating $2k+ on my credit card. What gets me is their systems can't even show that your order is on backorder, and per the customer service folks and I quote: ""You have to just keep calling"" to even find out the status. What in the actual fuq. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE NOT WORTH IT."
"i had galaxy S4 which i really loved best phone i had at that time.then i buy Galaxy S6 Edge+ phone after 3 month's it had dead pixel i took it to Samsung repair store and they fixed my phone within 2 days. the S6 Edge+ runs smooth and fast even after 1 year. so really love the phone."
"I tested out their Smartthings product - a set of internet connected sensors that allow you to automate various things around your house by sesing actions like doors opening and closing or movement being detected. The design of the product isn't too bad, and the ""things"" (as Samsung like to call their sensors) connected to the central hub (which connects the sensors to the internet and allows me to interface with the system through the app) fairly easily In theory, this product was a great idea and I was excited to try it, but when I tested it out I actually found that it had limited uses as of yet, because there aren't enough other devices that are compatible with the SmartThings ecosystem for me to be able to effectively automate many things in my house when the sensors detect triggers. ."
"Samsung is the worst manufacturer ever, I bought a Galaxy S7 Edge from them, the phone arrived and at first it seemed to work.Soon after, the phone started freezing, the only way to make it usable again was to hold volume- & power until it restarted.One time it froze while locked in my pocket, it got so hot that I thought it would explode.I called Samsung customer service, they booked in the phone. Samsung uses UPS to collect the phone and they give a day slot for pickup, which wastes your day waiting for them.Once repaired it arrived and after setting it up it froze again. I had to book it in a second time which also came back broken.At this point I asked to speak to a manager, due to their processes I had to wait for a call back from them scheduled for the next day at 11am. By 12pm they hadn’t called, so I had to call them, the chap Jordan Miller told me that I wasn’t booked in for that day. This was odd since I verified the booking and had cancelled my arrangements.Jordan Miller was on the phone with me for almost an hour, took lots of notes and booked the repair for a third time. This time Jordan guaranteed that I would get a working phone or it would be escalated to Head office.The phone was in their possession for two days when they called me, I couldn’t pick up, so the left a message to call them back but left no number.I called Samsung customer service, they told me that they hadn’t called me and that I should call the repair shop directly. I tried calling for two days, each time I called I was put on hold for an hour without anybody answering. Once I managed to get through they told me that phone was on its way back to me, since they couldn’t find a fault and I wasn’t available to give more information.I called back Samsung customer support and told them what has happened, they didn’t apologize. Instead they try to get me booked in a fourth time. I declined citing the previous agreement at which point they hanged up. After I calling back I managed to get in touch with Jordan Miller, he escalated the issue to head office and told me I would hear back with three working days.After a week I called them back to check up on the progress, I was told it hadn’t been processed by head office yet and that I would receive word when they had.Another week went by with no word so I called them, this time I was told the head office had reviewed my case and since last time they didn’t actually do anything with the phone, that I would have to send it back to them a fourth time.I declined, if they didn’t fix it first three times what guarantee did I have this time would be different.Avoid Samsung, their phones explode, their washing machines get recalled & their customer service is a joke."
"bought this j1 phone 4 months ago broke had it repaired that's a mission on its own now 7 months broke again could get it repaired but to be honest i just wont buy Samsung again this company is rapidly going down the drain along with there customer service"
"Over 5 weeks ago I sent my Galaxy S7 Edge in for repair. I waited for the full 10 day repair period before chasing. I called the repair centre number provided on the Tuesday afternoon and the female on the phone was the most disinterested member of staff ever, she ended up giving me another number, which I called on the Wednesday morning, only to be told Samsung were awaiting parts, which were due in on the Friday, for my phone to be repaired over the weekend and I should receive, at the latest, the following Wednesday. Wednesday came, no phone. I phoned on the Thursday morning and was told as my phone had not been repaired on time, I would be sent a replacement, this was all good until I found out the delivery time, another 7 to 10 working days. I am quite a patient person, so after 3 weeks of waiting, I could manage another 2. I asked if a tracking number could be provided, I was told no, which is rubbish, the phones are sent by courier. Couriers provide tracking numbers, simple right? No. So I contacted Samsung again 2 days ago and was told my phone was on the way by UPS, and then DPD (after being told on the previous phone call it was coming by Parcelforce) and was reminded of the 10 working day delivery time frame. So, 10 days was up yesterday. Still no phone. I have called them today, to be lied to again, an advisor called Mohammed tells me my phone is out for delivery and the timeframe is 7 to 14 days. Made up? I think so. After reiterating my situation and already rediculous amount of time Samsung have had my phone, he 'went to speak to the relevant department' came back to me and said I will be waiting another week for my phone. I'm not hopeful. I requested the phone be sent out within 24 hours, he adv this is not possible and when asked why, especially when other items can be shipped within 24 and he just said he can't do it. The conversation went on and I was getting nowhere. I requested the call be escalated and was told all the managers were in a meeting. Convenient huh? He said he can request a manager callback, but this would be within 24 hours, but would not be today (I was on the phone with them from 10am til half 10), it would be Monday. I asked again for a tracking number, he advised he would have to contact management to provide a tracking number and would get back to me, but there's no point as I would likely receive the phone first. I asked for him to put me through to someone I can log a complaint with and was answered with 'all complaints need to be put in writing'. I assume to try and discourage people to complain. Now, having worked in a callcentre myself, I appreciate the challenges that can be presented and I'm quite patient, but I must say, this has got to be one of the worst experience ever. I have been lied to numerous times.So, this whole thing is ridiculous. 6 weeks later I'm still without my phone and absolutely no idea when it will arrive.Is it wishful thinking to think Samsung may react in an appropriate manner to this complaint, which will also be sent direct to Samsung. Is it too much to ask for a 24 hour courier service to send my my phone?"
"For those buying Samsung products of any kind, when you pick up your phone or switch on your TV, think about this.  South Korea take part in some of the most horrific torture to dogs and cats on the planet yet Samsung are not interested in helping this improve, they turn a blind eye and are solely interested in their profits.  Millions of dogs and cats are boiled alive, hung up and asphyxiated, hung up and blowtorched, limbs and paws cut off and skinned, all whilst still being ALIVE and fully conscious as these people believe the more they torture the animal, the better the meat will taste.  There are millions of dogs every year who are born in these cages and for their whole lives are in the hands of these individuals and they witness daily the horrific killings of their friends and family around them.  South Korea and Samsung bring shame to the world and the only way this can improve for these animals is for us to stop buying anything from companies like Samsung who are unethical and profit hungry. Shame shame shame on you Samsung."
"I had bought a 46"" LED TV in November 2014 believing that it is a good brand and I will never face a problem with the product but recently the screen panel is shut down on its own. The product has never been mishandled or it has never gone through any external impact and one day it stopped working. On contacting the service center they are suggesting to pay more than 1/3 rd of the cost of TV just to repair the product."
"Until this purchase I have never been let down by samsung products but this pathetic customer service experience has turned me right off.  Bought TV from ao.com, dead remote, ao.com fobbed me off direct to manufacturer samsung without even answering the phone!  I called ao.com and pressed options for faulty TV and was automatically transferred direct to samsung technical suppport.  So rude!  Then the eastern tech giant's massive wheels begin to turn by creating a support ticket pending investigation all for a simple dead remote control!!!!  18 days later I get delivery notification.  Let's see if the replacement remote works..."
"I bought a new Samsung TV for my parents and not only the quality was quite low, but they just kept running into several issues with that TV. I know that their smartphones have battery issues, but I thought that a huge company like Samsung could ensamble products following some ethics rules. They are scammers, they should spend some money improving their components instead of throwing so much money to some marketing agencies.I won't buy any of Samsung products again, not even If they're on sale. You save money at first just to spend money soon after."

"I sent in my galaxy 6 edge because it quit working after having it for 3 months.    I bought it brand new.  They sent it back and tried to tell me someone had opened the back.   They wouldn't replace or fix it when it was a manufacturer defect.   The phone was on the charger and when taken off just went black.  No one ever touched it other than every day use."
"Bought an LED TV and had some issues with it. Tried to contact online customer support but nobody was able to give me clear indications regarding their service network. Called them and after about 2 days I managed to receive the precious information I was looking for.On the bright side, the technician was very professional and fixed the problem very quickly."
"I have bought 2 samsung cell phones, first Galaxy S3 and now Galaxy S6. Both hangs alot."
"I travelled to Hawaii for my honey moon with my wife. I bought not one but two Samsung micro SD to store the thousands of pictures and hundreds of videos we recorded during those amazing days. We used them both in a new cell phone and goPro camera also bought in Hawaii. Once back at home, while watching the pictures with our families the micro SD corrupted and all the data stored there was lost. Believing I still had the pictures and videos on the goPro, a couple of days later I tried to watch and download them and the same had happened. Everything lost! Not once but twice. Without any handling error or hardware harmed. All of a sudden we lost all our honey moon's memories.I had my wife crying for many days and it's still a difficult topic to talk about. Completely disappointed by Samsung. I tried to reach their customer service and they rejected me several times. They only offered me replacing the micro SD!!! They made fun of meI will never ever buy a samsung device again. I was used to Apple's customer service but they don't sell memory cards yet.I can't understand how they can sell such deffective products!"
"samsung is a hge behind the back scammerhigly not recommend to buy thier prosucts"
"I will never buy another Samsung product in my life. Slow, always freezes, turns off on Its own, battery is stuffed after 8 months, not enough phone data and has and awkward kind of size in some models.This phone takes me 30 minutes to send ONE text when it should take 3 seconds.After this experience, I am completely 100% annoyed with Samsung as a brand and this will impact my preferences in the near future when buying a new mobile phone."
"I bought a refrigerator from Sears display brand new and has never used just few scratches on the body. Ice maker is making only few cubes ice and I called support. First it is hard to understand their accent and they are not helpful. They asked me if less than a year send the receipt which was only 6 month I bought it and sent the receipt after few days they told me it is not under warrenty because it was not bought brand new I told them it has never used they said their record doesn't show that and nothing they can do. They can send service but they want to charge me what a company that they don't support their products"
"Purchased a s7 edge in march fast forward June after a update the screen was unresponsive took it to there shop who confirmed it was a hardware problem I rang customer service who stated they could only repair device as phone was only few months old told them not happy I was told basically take it or leave it which I thought was very disappointing after spending £630 for device I was told take it to the retailer if I wanted a replacement they did not realise they were who I purchased off Samsung still not budgen trying to fob me off luckily I purchased thru PayPal credit and have started a dispute I will be avoiding this company from now on never had a problem before but this has left a bad taste in my mouth"
"I have a Samsung S5 still under warranty and the cover to the charging port fell off.  They are telling me I have to send in my device for repair and be without a phone for up to 2 weeks or longer.  Samsung has been my phone of choice for more than 10 years.  Samsung will no longer be my phone of choice for the poor customer service and warranty."
"I always buy Samsung and I am delighted!"
"I have already a third Samsung flagship mobile. And I have to say that when I get one I am impressed by functionality and quality, but disappointed for limitations (root; Knoxx).I don’t give them a high score mostly, though, for the software updates they provide. There are always issues with newer software. Usually it’s worse than its predecessor. Last available update for Galaxy S4 was simply terrible.That leaves me with buying their products, but at the same time, always searching for better option."
"I have samsung phone galaxy A5 which is only 7 months old and i visited customer service center almost 5 times but they still not able to resolve my phone problem even they guys crack my phones camra glass and now did not accept it most cheap .... never go with samsung guys"
"Beware! I do not recommend it at all. They are the worst. I have left my S5 at SAMSUNG technical service from Spain, REGENERSIS, they have made the phone useless, they put the phone in a special sealing furnace because the display it was broken, and now is curved, with a fully taken-off display, and now feign ignorance after a payment of 180€ repair, plus what I paid 6 months ago. I pulled my money and my time for nothing. Impossible to solve with the customer service. After had told me the at technical service REGENERSIS, that phone is USELESS, the customer service tryed to solve the problem offering me to reassess again the phone for a possible repair??!!!! I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. I will NEVER again buy one. If you don't know to repair a Samsung S5, How can we assume that they know to repair the new Samsung S7?!!!¡¡CUIDADO, que no se os estropee!! Lo del servicio técnico de SAMSUNG, REGENERSIS, es de vergüenza. Son lo peor. Me han dejado inservible un S5 y se lavan las manos. Se me rompió el display y al meterlo en un horno para termo-sellarlo lo han curvado y ahora el cristal se despega totalmente. Está inservible y se desentienden después de haber pagado 180€ de reparación, mas lo que me costó hace tan solo 6 meses. He desperdiciado mi tiempo y dinero. Imposible solucionarlo con Atención al Cliente. Después de decirme el servicio técnico REGENERESIS que el teléfono está INSERVIBLE, me ofrecen en Atención al Cliente volver a valorar el teléfono para ¡¡¡¿¿repararlo??!!! ¿Se imagina alguien, si han hecho esto con un Samsung S5, lo que harían con uno de los nuevos Samsung S7? TREMENDO. NO LO RECOMIENDO EN ABSOLUTO."
"They sell defective tvs and they rip your money for their defects"
"Well if you think iPhone is the best, I don’t mind. But if you see the entire picture, you will find there are many innovations and trends started by Samsung as well. No doubt Apple's iPhones are technically far superior, but it is the competition that makes for better products and gives us a better option to choose.If you see the latest Samsung Galaxy Note Series and S series phones, there has been a considerable use of innovative technology and better specs some of which are much better than iPhones.I thing I need to add here is i didn't like the error 53 concept by Apple.So if you ask me, I keep a Galaxy and an iPhone in my pocket as I need both! Sometimes Apple works while sometimes Samsung works!Overall Samsung phones are reliable and easy-to-use."
"I bought a smart TV and I really enjoy this in every time. Thanks samsung!!!"
"I bought Samsung Galaxy A5 and I'm furious. Why I can't change themes? Why I can't add photos to contacts? Also I can't play games because battery quickly runs out."
"I had Sony phone, LG, Siemens, Nokia. I have Samsung from 3 months and what? Very weak!The phone still has problems with good and stable working."
"I've bought Curved S series smart TV as a special offer in website. And save $2500! it's a very good deal. Picture is clear and sound is good. I enjoy it."
"It is not android, something else is extremely wrong on this cells, I tried the galaxy S4 and the S5, their are extremely slow, do not even bother to get the 6, I simple moved to Iphone, but my girl have a Sonys Cell and is much, much better and even cheaper !"
"I have used the samsung mobiles. What I have found that their pricing structure is pretty high. No doubt the features are pretty advanced but the processing is too slow and the phones hangs up too much. So I suffered personally, and made a switch back to Nokia brand, an established and proven one."
"Bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 from the Samsung UK site, just yesterday. Advertised as reduced from £349 to £199. Also stated ""nearly out of stock"". Paid by credit card, purchase accepted, email to confirm order, even downloaded the VAT receipt. Today they called and told me they have cancelled it and will refund. When pressed, she would only say ""problem with our systems"". Was told I could try to order again, but at £349. She would not register my complaint. Also now received an email notification, stating that it is cancelled at MY request! Have written a complaint and will send to Head Office shortly. Am fuming. This must border on illegal? Anyone else get stung? I will re-post if Samsung take any notice and remedy my complaint."
"Me - You have sent me a Jiffy bag to return a boxed phone, it will not fit into a Jiffy bag that must be for sending the unit only for repair.XIaoMi - Yes please use the bag to return the phone.If you want to waste your time completely with people who cannot comprehend what you are saying and have an overly complicated returns system then by all means by directly from XiaoMi.Great phones, awful customer service and should only be bought via a third party vendor.I have bought, returned and bought again in the time I have been waiting for XiaoMi to sort out a return for the phone I bought.Shambolic customer service representatives and I even speak Chinese! I have no idea where these people are hired from but they are terrible in any language."
"Absolute disgrace, ordered on the 20th November, constantly told that items were shipped but DHL confirmed they were not. Have had to go through bank fraud team to get money back.Avoid at all costs."
"Xiaomi UK refused to fix my phone even though I was willing to pay for the repair all because it was a global version bought from Hong Kong.No phone shops have parts to fix my phone nor have they heard of this brand. I can buy a new screen online but to fix it myself are you mad!Needless to say a phone is paid £244 for got binned due to not being able to get it repaired.Can't believe they would not fix it when I'm willing to pay when they have the knowledge and products to fix the phone. Steer clear!!"
"I have no idea who is responsible for creating a waiting timer for unlocking the bootloader. This can only be just a freaking Joke of yours Xiaomi. I have waited a total of 7 days already and should be now actually able to unlock the bootloader. But what is going on? It does not work! I tried today to unlock the bootloader, but the unlock tool tells me again that I have to wait another 168 hours (7 days) again to unlock the bootloader. What the actual f* is going on Xiaomi?! Are you completely core-disabled or anything? I didn't do nothing in the time that could have reset or interrupt the process of unlocking my bootloader and you garbage disposals seriously make me wait that long again? Burn all of you in hell you dirty inbred Chinese Xiaomi Devs! This was my last purchase of your garbage Xiaomi Phones. Never again."
"Worst phones ever. Every second phone has manufacturing defect. Fraudulent and harassing product mr.manu (false,cheater)jain"
"I honestly have had zero issues since placing my order. I was sceptical after reading reviews but I wanted the black Friday offer so I used PayPal and hoped for the best. Ordered on Tuesday and my it's were dispatched on the Friday, I received my parcel the following Friday after a 2 day delay from DHL but that was no fault of Xiaomi. Products received are great quality and arrived in great condition. Have not had to contact customer services yet so can't comment on that side of it and the website is slightly aggregating but the technology in their devices is great especially for the price. I'm very pleased with everything"
"I have ordered a Redmi Note 8 Pro on 20th Nov 2020 which is not even processed for shipment even though they quote shipment within 3-5 working days. After insisting in my call last Friday to receive the status in an email, I received an email yesterday  stating that ""Upon checking your order details, your package is currently with our logistic platform awaiting for DHL to collect and make the delivery. You will receive a notification once your package has been collected for delivery."" I responded to their email asking why they are giving false hopes to prospective customers by quoting unrealistic timelines (3-5 or 5-7 working days for shipment) on their website. Today in the call, I was told that the order is still being processed and will be informed once it is shipped and I can expect response to my email in next 24-48 hrs.. Instead of giving typical reply to keep waiting, they should have accepted their mistake of not keeping sufficient stock before launching any offers. I would say this is the worst customer service and even their website is utterly poor to contact/check for any updates on our orders. I would have rated in negative for the kind of customer service and logistics/delivery mechanism they have in spite of boasting to be a large International company."
"Worst customer service experience of my life. First, they asked me for a serial number that appears nowhere on the box, nor the product (LED bulb), nor the app. Even after sending tons of pictures and asking for clarifications, they wouldn't help me to find this serial number that is probably only written somewhere inside the bulb. Also, the order was made on their own website and they already had all the information needed.After this was ""solved"" by me inventing a serial number, they kept asking again for information that I had already provided three times in the course of our month-long email exchange.I still haven't managed to send this item for reparation, and I have lost hope by now. My advice would be to never buy one of their products, no matter how cheap they are."
"Great phones! I've been using for 1 year redmi 8 and it workd very well"
"I ordered a Mi10T and a car charger on their website. A Xiaomi airpod was also included in my order as a gift which has terrible quality. More importantly, I have never received a car charger and I proved it to them on their online chat with a photo of the delivery box on the delivery date. I had correspondence with them which took days and their irrelevance brought me a point to ask for a refund but they are still stalling me with fraudulent approach. They simply received payment but they haven't sent the product and they are not refunding now. I strongly recommend to stay away from this company."
"Their website is clunky and their offers are stupid. I'm trying to collect uncollectible stars to get some form of discount. You don't give me any stars, I won't give you any either.Why make it so difficult for people to buy from you?"
"Customer support is completely useless and can't do anything about the placed orders. They couldn't even change the billing address so I could pay for my order. And obviously, trying to re-order a product that's on sale isn't going to work, as it was sold out! If they don't want money from their customers, then why they even bother running a store?"
"They serialise their parts, which basically means they're unfixable.Wouldn't recommend..."
"Waste of money don't buy any products from Xiaomi redmi MI don't buy any products of this disappointed company.their phone's are third class and their services are third class too. they don't know how to run a company. i had purchased redmi note 8 pro third class phone by mistakly and after 4 days this third class phone is showing his colour's like camera is not working,shades are coming in WhatsApp ,Instagram. And photos are not getting saved in gallery after we click it in wire angle .Xiaomi should give counter seat of service center to aducated people not to illiterate people who don't know how to talk.service of MI is very very very disappointed. Oppo is very good company its phone's are very awesome and it gives very best service also.nt like this third class brand redmi mi . I will never ever purchase any thing from this illiterate company.oppo is giving best phone's in less prices and giving best services and they know how to talk what to talk how to behave with their customers. The worst service of MI you will get in (prime mall irla vile parle west).if I was knowing about this company before I didn't buyed it in my life ever never.byt still!! . Now so am hoping that you third class company will give me some good service next time. The owner of Xiaomi should go and put his face in camod 5 times and the seller of MI too and service people should suicide soon!!!  Good byeeee MI ...."
"Terrible company. Been trying to return something for over a month. The system kept give me an error when try to do a return. I've emailed them about it and was told they will pass it on the management to do the return. I've messaged many times and they keep telling me that they're waiting for them to sort it. It's been a month!!! Never had so much trouble with a company before. Wouldn't recommend."
"Xiaomi UK of Reading deducted 3 amounts of £229 yesterday from one of my credit cards. I have never bought anything from this company so basically this is theft. My advice would be beware of dealing with this company & watch your bank accounts & credit cards for their name."
"The devices are really good for the price, if your from any 1st world country its not for you but in South Asia and africa the brand isna deal breaker , MI is the most sold in india which says alot of it's quality and performance"
"Waste of money as any problems they are not willing to help  and a lot of the scooter seem to have a fault and stop turning on"
"Just got my xiaomi mi10 lite 5g this week and am very happy with it. It's fast, its clear and has been a positive experience so far. A bit worried about the longevity given some reviews on here, which I hadn't read before I bought it. Bloatware is usual. But I am liking it! The 64 megapixel camera is nice (Sony sensor).  The others pretty pointless. I am happy overall. Great value for money."
"I bought 2 mobile devices from xiaomi and both are damaged due to bettery problems and just within 2 years. really bad experience. I will never buy anything from their company and i recommend to stay away from this scam company."
"Absolutely horrible experience. They sent my order to the wrong address and refused to assist me in claiming a refund. The customer service are absolutely useful if you ask them something that's not on their script. It feels like talking to a broken robot."
"Xiaomi has a excellent customer service in UK. My experience with them has been very positive and was very happy with the way the dealt with my issue.Tanweer Ahmed"
"Your company is not helpful or useful for repair And the most rubbish company I know"
"yeah so far I only bought 2 SHlTAOMI devices1. is android box tv2. wifi repeaterthe android box died for no apparent reason in just less than a monththe wifi repeater?? after painstakingly try to set up this little piece of sh-t the wifi simply said that there is no connectionand altho I never bought any of their SHlTY cheap phonesI hear countless other people complaining about their SHlTAOMI  phone suddenly died, got mushroom and mold on the back of the phone, and a shltton of malware and adware preinstalled,long story short shltaomi is the embodiment of Chinese products: cheap and expendableOh and btw what a ridiculous name for a companyI understand some basic mandarinand Xiaomi means literally ""small rice"" base on their hanziwhat a SHlTTY name: small rice???yeah even if there is a gun pointed to my head I wont buy any  SHlTAOMI  products ever againoh and those peoples giving 5 stars?don't believe themthey are obviously either a BOT or a SHlTAOMI  employees"
"Xiaomi got a major problem where by they do not want to cover international warranty. Lets say you travel to another country buy a Xiaomi watch, phone , electric scooter, hoover or any of the xiaomi products. Xiaomi will not cover your warranty if you happen to get home and it develops a fault. They will tell you take it back to the country you've bought it from even thou its a manufacturer fault and they operate their services in the country you are located in.. If Xiaomi looks to compete against the likes of Apple, Microsoft, LG, Panasonic, Samsung and many other market leaders. They will need to honour their warranty globally and be able to help customers who may have bought a product abroad that develops a manufacturer fault.This issue is pretty serious and should be blown up in the media. The current terms on how they cover warranty and what's covered in general is very limited and they may as well not provide a warranty cover period.IF xiaomi fixes this issue as soon as possible and improves their terms and conditions at least then customers can feel oblige to purchase Xiaomi products. Until then i Cannot recommend and wouldn't recommend Xiaomi."
"My scooter is faulty and they fix again it’s get back tyre got jammed and I got accident I got hurt in my both knees  and now they don’t want follow up my scooter details every time they have some excuses we waiting from Headoffice to come back to us or they will call you No one has called me this is 3weeks very poor services and poor quality scooter £400 I paid them I given them proof of accident and purchase still no answer from this Xamoxi MI SCOOTER Seriously don’t buy this product unless you really want to waste time like me.when they want to sell they making big promises now in reality it’s very difficult Chiness people.China is fake item Xamoxi too fake company"
"These phones are cheap but the operating system is clunky and does not allow some apps to install from Google play store. For example Samsung Smart things app for TV and devices."
"Worst service I ever had with any mobile manufacturer the last 18 years that I own a mobile phone.Absolutely no response after my feedback and my requests to communicate.No updates sent, lots of bugs that are not fixed etc"
"Xiaomi makes high-performance Android phones that run the latest specs and hardware and then it sells them for around 60% less than the competition. It has always done this. And this is why it has grown so fast."
"Stay away from this Company, they are a complete scam.  I ordered 4 products from them months ago, which I never received.  I have reached out to customer service US, who states they cannot assist and refers me to Global, although I am in the US, Global says they cannot assist and that I have to go through US Customer Service....so no resolution.  I have my invoice/order#, yet there is no way to track or view your order.  Do not buy anything from this company, avoid them...you will regret it if you do try to purchase from them!!!!!"
"Bought a Redmi Note 9 Pro 2 weeks ago. I am absolutely delighted. My old Samsung 8+ was needing too many charges so time for a new phone. I was apprehensive but no need.I bought from Mi store at £209 which included Mi Band 5.The phone is pure quality. The screen is crystal clear and a joy to watch movies and football.I am still learning about the camera but so far I am really impressed. Clarity is excellent.The Mi Band 5 is also really good. I transferred to this from my Samsung Gear Sport. It's obviously more basic but does most things apart from making payments as no NFC.I have no issues recommending Xiaomi."
"Redmi Note 9Do not buy this phone, it is lagging and hanging from day 1, customer care support is not showing any response, they will give you a particular date and they will not call you back anytime, response is horrible, worst service ever encountered, my order I’d is 5200827874723888 and my complaint I’d is WOIN20200910000484"
"This is one of the money grabbing not to care company. I had the please in purchasing a scooter from Halfords. After the motor stopped working, I only had it for 4 weeks. I was directed to Xiaomi to be fixed, they tried everything not to fix it. At the end I contacted Halfords, after threatening them with legal action, Halfords replaces it. Don’t purchase from Xiaomi. And make sure you go back to Halfords and demand for them to deal with it. Even Halfords tried not to help."
"AVOID Brought a Redmi Note 8T from Three after reading good reviews of a high spec phone at a great price. Unfortunately the build quality is atrocious and customer service awful.The phone suddenly wouldn't charge after about three months. The Three store told me to contact Xiaomi. After several calls with different advisers each time having to start from square one I was sent a prepaid envelope to send to their Xiaomi UK repair centre. It was returned with a note saying there was liquid contamination and the phone was beyond repair as the parts were no longer available. There has been no liquid contamination while I have used the phone and it has been treated no differently than previous phones I've had. Another fraught session of multi calls to Xiaomi and they passed me back to Three. Three say it is Xiaomi's responsibility. AVOID"
"I purchased Redmi note 9 pro at 25 july. Recive the phone open and was okay. Then i backup my data from previous phone through cloud and after that some icon on top slide bar was missing for example gps etc. Okay i restart phone to factory reset and and i install everything by Google Play. Icon was okay but i had one issue which was occur for 2 weeks during i had phone. Basically i had problem with minimize chrome. My scren goes funny during this. Dont know how to explain but only chrome did it. I restart phone few times. In meantime i also spot once or twice problem with unlocked phone after unlocked screen was empty for few sec. Anotber thing couldn't unlocked my lloyds account with fingerprints scanner but the scanner was working.  So during this time i contact xiaomi support, they organize jiffy bag for faulty returns (6 August). After got it was few days gone, then i send it back to SBE on 20 of august as i recive jiffy bag this day, they received my phone one day later which was 21 of august but founded in warehouse on 26 august and they said they couldn't replicate my issue so they send me phone back. And of course they not going to find anything if phone is on factory reset. And im 100 % sure they havent done any check. So now because whole process from get jiffy bag to get any answer regard test took so long my normal return time gone. But i want return still. I dont want same phone which will have issue again after i will insatll my app. Second thing is apparently they send phone back to me. Didnt gave me any tracking nr. No contact no phone no money. Avoid this company!!!!"
"**AVOID THIS COMPANY** Ordered a Redmi phone over a week ago and it's still not arrived. Had to supply ID on Monday of this week - this was done immediately. The phone remains on hold at DHL. I have sent several emails asking if Xaoimi can give me a date as to when I will receive what I have paid for. Unfortunately, every email response from them is vague and does not answer my questions. I have asked to cancel my order and get a full refund. The first two phone calls I had regarding this I was told they couldn't do it. I informed them of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 where it states 'the seller is liable for the delivery'. Xaoimi DO NOT adhere to this, they make their own rules and laws. I have been told that they will cancel my order and when the item is back with them from DHL only then will they issue my refund. I'm not actually sure this is following the law. I DO NOT TRUST this company at all...I am not confident that they will issue my refund.**AVOID THIS COMPANY** terrible lack of customer service and definitely NOT a UK customer service centre!"
"My daughter and I recently bought Xiaomi Redmi phones. She has a Note 9 and I have a Note 9 Pro. We have no complaints so far, excellent phones for the money."
"All good as long as you don't have a problem.I've been really lucky using Xiaomi stuff, I've been impressed with there updates which seem better than most and they are pretty flexable.There kits great for the price.But you need to understand they are not a Western company so don't expect A+ customer services if you have issue. (TBH don't expect A+ service from any phone company any more)Hopefully some of the big UK network pick them up in place of Huawei who in my mind need removing from the face of the earth."
"I bought xiaomi black shark 3 and was surprise that the after only 3days use i observe that the battery life will only last for 1day in normal use and not with heavy talk time. I return to service center and what they did was just also observe the unit and doesnt have any tools to tests the parts are still within the specifications,I did ask the technician if the 1 day battery life of black shark 3 is within the normal specifications of xiaomi and he said yes.I dont beleive that because before i buy the product ive red that battery life of black shark 3 will lasts longer since its trademark was a ""gaming phone"" so i was thinking since i am not a gaming user it will add more on my black shark 3 battery life.Who can tell me now the true specification of black shark 3 if xiaomi itself doesnt know it???"
"I have ordered a phone after 1 week the has not been delivered and my order has not been processed. Ihave contacted the customer service 4 times in the week as there is no chang in the status for a week. Evry time i call they give same answer saying will be delivered on certain date. I call before the day of deliver as well same answer but when I asked how it is possible for the  them to deliver my phone with out even processing my order. They said they will mail there warehouse and reply me back in a day. I contacted after one day still the same. Then they said there manager will call me and reslove my issue, i waited for whole day no call. I called them again they siad i am 3rd in the line for call but day passed no call and my orde has not even been processed after so may calls. They say its in there wearhouse everytime i called."
"UK customer service for Xiaomi are completely unwilling to help. Purchased a brand new Xiaomi note 8 in April and it's faulty. Xiaomi inform me it is not under warranty! Battery is also rubbish."
"If you thinking of buying a Xiaomi product DON'T""They claim to have a UK department but they do not. I bought a xami note 8 pro in March only After 3 Moths it occurs a fault I called and they ask to send it back i did after that when it get repair and sent back I’m the problem is still there call them again they told me to send it again i did sent it 4 times as it’s been not fixed After 4th time I been told they have to farword this to the relevant department and someone call me to discuss the issue and I been waiting for weeks to get call back but they didn’t I am the one chasing this and calling them again and again every time I been told someone will call u but no call back I am tied of this sort of customer service as they don’t have proper department to deal this kind of issue only they have customer representatives to deal the calls only they can’t provide and information or can sort the problem but only to email to the higher department and the higher department don’t have time to look the issue or try to call u to resolve the matter So please BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM THINK TWICE otherwise if it get faulty you will suffer like you never been before"
"If you thinking of buying a Xiaomi product in the UK ""DON'T""They claim to have a UK department but they do not. And if they take your purchase back under warranty it may never reyturn (Like my M365 scooter).I had 2 scooters purchased a week apart break 6 months later a week apart. Maybe a coincidence but i believe they have timers or are designed to fail when they update the firmware."
"Don't let the competitive price and the hardware fool youMy Redmi Note 7 is much slower than its competitors with the same specs. Apps regularly freeze with only minor load, the battery drains fast because the phone doesn't kill background apps. The screen has a yellowish color and so no precision in displaying colors; only the back camera is decent in good light thanks to built in Hdr. It recieved updates for less than one year for the Trump ban. Theq assistence is dead, they take week to respond and don't solve the problm. Be aware with plastic sides ad glass back the phone will be very fragile. Stay away from the phones of this brand"
"I am a doctor working for the NHS and use the work daily travelling to the nearby hospital my scooter developed a fault I rang Xiaomi Customer service up and told them about the fault which is still under warranty it a one week and no further forward in getting it repaired And me calling every day asking when it will be resolved Today I demanded to speak to a manger who informed me apparently They are waiting for China to authorise repair absolutely rubbish customer service department Please do not buy their products11/8 Finally picked up for repair over four week from when first raised fault"
"I ordered a Redmi Note 9S on 20th and delivered by DHL express from France (to UK) on 22nd!  Amazing service, very easy to order and had tracking info etc when it had left as well.  Phone arrived and is amazing and for the price it has the lot.  It even came with a case and screen protector."
"I'm so happy to receive my package with smart lights for my new flat. All working nice and connecting very fast. All of the devices are linked via Google Home. I do recommend!"
"Very poor service. they use rubbish dhl to deliver the product. waiting whole day for delivery nothing yet. Evern Xiaomi can't give any update. If you need phone within few days avoid them"
"I normally never review, but after reading the many negative reviews I had to share my experience.After I ordered a mobile off their official store, I stumbled across the reviews on trust pilot and was very worried.However my experience was very good, ordered on Monday, received on Wednesday, no problems at all. I hope my case is not an anomaly.(UK customer)"
"Yes. Xiaomi finds crude and clever excuses to refuse product support, including air purifier, earbuds, and smartphone. I have all three in Thailand."
"Do not deal with this company or their products. Diabolical service and would not repair under warranty and made excuses. They are just ripping of people."
"SKV4060GL Mi Handheld Vacuum Cleaner.... Acquistato a fine novembre 2019 ha già smesso di funzionare.... Fin dall inizio ha aspirato poco per poi mollarci definitivamente.... Sto cercando di contattare l azienda per riparazione... Peccato mi fidavo di xiaomi."
"I just wish i can leave 1 Star review for this Xiaomi. Their phones are fine but do not order than from their official UK store. because there isn't any in the UK. They Ship out the mobiles from France. If there is an issue they have a UK telephone number but these lot can only view the information and cannot do anything about it. AVOID AVOID AVOID !!"
"Althrough Xiaomi is a popular brand but there are some pros and cons of the mi products. As i have good idea of gadgets and i have been in this industry for last 3-4 years so i want to mention a genuine review with you guys.Redmi Note 8 pro- let's talk about it as it is recently launched before Redmi note 9 pro and i am using it. I found some security issues. As we all know Redmi products are available in less price but with amazing features.But how they cut money no one aware with it.As in Redmi mobiles you will found issue with its touch sensitivity and sensors. you can use touch even with cloths there is no skin recognizing sensor.As company can invest more money on its software and improve its software and can provide more effective features with user reviews. but they don't do so.They just once finish target for one smartphone and they they stop updating improving it. As they implement it in next model and they call those updated features as new feature in next model.But overall i see the processor and camera performance i do not find lack even during heavy use."
"Mi is providing the worst service these days. They ask you for online payment. Don't deliver your product on time. Customer Care executive talks rudely and doesn't try to solve your problem even if it's a mistake on their part. No option to cancel or ask for refund and there you get stuck in their trap for 7-9 working days needed to make the refund! Highly disappointed!"
"To begin with'premium phone,' is awful. But that's my fault for poor research. What is appalling is the customer services.After sending me a broken phone it took 4 months to get them to swap it. Which they never did they just sent the broken phone back.Originally they told me that it wasn't my phone so they wouldn't fix it despite buying direct from the company.Every customer service rep promised the world. But they just have a script to fob customers off.Using words like I personally promised to fix this for you and please don't worry I'll personally take care of it.All lies.I made a bad purchase and it will stay with me. Please don't make the same mistake. Buy cheap buy twice."
"Idropped my xiaomi mi 9 lite ,and it damaged therear camera glass lens cover,I informed xiaomi customer services uk and they sent a jiffy bag for me to send the phone th SBE LTDI knew I would have to pay for the damage as it was my fault, SBE LTD received my phone on the 18 march 2020, and the cost would be £77.28.After numerous phone calls to SBE LTD and Xiaomi customer services I was told waiting for components.SBE LTD had my phone from the 18march 2020 until the 13 may 2020, seven weeks and still no sigh of a repair ,so I informed SBE LTD to send me my phone back and also a refund, thanks to SBE LTD they sent me a full refund..phone still needs repairing.Xiomi customer services have been no help whatsoever in getting components ,totally useless customer service.Spoke to them on 19 may said they would see what has happened to parts, and would get back to me  Still waiting.Would give them no stars if I could"
"Had 3 of their devices without any issues, but bought a Mi Mix 3 5G from their website directly a month ago (04/2020) and they aren't updating the device past MIUI 10 (latest update for MIUI 12 has come out), with MIUI 10 being obsolete. Contacted them and they say they're working on an update but they can't give me any sort of timescale as to when this will happen, if at all. Avoid if you want a phone which gets the latest software features with updates."
"Ordered an Xiaomi 9T phone and paid with PayPal. I checked for dispatch and no sign of same. Checked shipping progress and did not see any dispatch. Contacted seller and I was asked to cancel order as there was water damage in warehouse. On checking my bank account found that the payment and refund were on the same day !. Would not buy from seller again no matter what the price"
"I ordered Mi Beard Trimmer the seal was broken, after two days I called customer care she told It cannot be replaced bco'z I have to call within 24 hours. Then I told I will report to consumer court she replied do what ever you want.Please don't buy this china product they are sending all returned and used products and not worth for money."
"My phone was shipped from Paris yesterday at 5pm and arrived at my home in Glasgow in less than 24 hours. I had full DHL tracking and followed the entire journey. Very happy."
"Their courier stole our package before it was even delivered. We filed a police report (as requested) and submitted it along with an affidavit that we never received the package. For over 2 months they stalled, refusing to refund or replace and just saying ""they were looking into it"". Eventually, we got a full refund. Awful company - a joke. Do not buy from them."
"Bought a Xiaomi 8 pro from mi UK came from France ended up Manchester then delivered to me in Leigh lancs.completely open ripped box.no mobile phone, with an air freshener instead  inside.told the foreign driver,who took photos then rang his boss who was foreign he said they would return it. I then tried to cancel payment with my bank used a debit card ,stupidly..no joy..got on to Amazon through online chat..They were excellent very sympathetic and refunded the whole cost..so thumbs up for amazon but avoid mi UK ,terrible robbing courier service ,which apparently happens a lot."
"I was taken in by the ""official Xiaomi store"" after studying reviews and specs I decided the MI 9 Lite was prefect for me, ordered it in January on offer and received an empty box. Xiaomi have never refunded me, the credit card company did. Xiaomi asked me to send a signed statement about getting the empty box, photos of the box, a copy of photo ID (this worried me a lot), and a pdf of a Met Police page which is no more than a list of the type of lost property you might be reporting and of no use whatsoever, I don't live in the Met Police area, the phone wasn't lost it was clearly stolen, the tape on the box was cut open and it had been resealed with DPD tape. I tried reporting it to the police and DPD after seeking advice from Victim Support, neither wanted to know because Xiaomi had said they were investigating, and wait for a refund then I could reorder! It was after this I googled Xiaomi official store and found all these horror stories about empty boxes, trouble getting refunds or rubbish replacements. I've now got an Oppo on contract."
"Electric scooter came loose when I was on it. Luckily I only suffered a couple of bruises but they are not safe.I sent it in to Xoami and they tried to charge me £80 for the “repair bill”. I would strongly avoid buying anything from this company."
"0 stars. Pretty much like everyone else on here I've received an empty box in February 2020 through their terrible collisimo courier.. After 80 days 6 emails and 8 phone calls (mostly made by me) they've issued me a refund without any notification or an apology. Shocking experience and company. Wouldn't ever expect that from 4th largest mobile phone company in the world... The most funny thing about this is the fact that at the bottom of their emails it says 'believe in something magical is about to happen' Well that truly was very magical! NOT! I guess this was both a lesson and a sign. With that said there were a couple of good people in their customer service team that did listen and tried to help. As a brand their processes are very damaging..."
"Took 3 weeks to come but worth the wait redmi 8 pro top phone :) delivered by DHL."
"Worst company every. I bought a mi mix 3 5G Here in the Netherlands with some discount because I extended my contract with my provider, but it's still a expensive phone. I have still security patch of November 2019 and Miui 10 Android 9. No one who can help the mods of the mi community tried to help but 0 response of Xiaomi. Meanwhile Xiaomi stopped developing miui 11 and is already started with miui 12. This phone is aboned by Xiaomi ."
"I held out posting my review until I came to a conclusion but it has been 8 weeks from original purchase with no conclusion in the near future. So I have decided to post my experience.03.03.20 I purchased 2 orders: Order 1; Mi Mix 3 5g & Redmi ProOrder 2; Mi Mix 3 5g & Mi Band ChargerThey were on promotion and I've talked friends into buying Xiaomi products so I was getting myself and my family these as presents for upcoming birthdays.After 2 weeks I received order 1 however only the Redmi was in the parcel. I immediately emailed and explained the situation. They told me sometimes packages come separately (I found that strange as the invoice for the entire purchase was in the parcel I received).In the same email I asked where Order 2 was, they told me they had issues with their delivery service Colissimo (read their reviews, I didn't and after ordering I read them and completely terrified myself which details theft and lost parcels within this delivery service) and they were working to find out where orders went missing. Fast forward weeks of emails which included Xiaomi telling me to send ID & Police documentation and to 'keep waiting'. I told them I contacted my solicitor and my solicitor told me that it is completely unacceptable as it could easily lead to identity fraud. They immediately backed down and began stating the case was being sent to 'higher management' and I would receive my refund 'soon' .After 6 weeks from original purchase they finally admitted the delivery service was unacceptable and they have now cut ties with Colissimo and refunded my order number 2. But still remained the issue that the Mi Mix 3 5g was missing from Order 1 which they had admitted was to the fault of the French Delivery Service Colissimo. I have now contacted my bank and as of 12.04.20 they are completing a chargeback on the purchase minus the price of the Redmi which I did receive. However this process can take up to a further 60 days. Simply speaking I regularly buy phones from many services and am the 'tech guy' amongst friends and family. This has been highly stressful situation as the service agents use template replies which do not answer your questions. More of a 'wait and see' tool to buy themselves time. Xiaomi have now moved their delivery system entirely to DHL which is great however, as a company themselves they have a lot to envy in comparison to many of the UK companies. Cheap deals will only take you so far and without suitable customer services will not build a strong customer base.I am now patiently waiting for Lockdown to end so I can contact my solicitor and see what the next port of call is. Don't put yourself through this situation stick to your reputable sellers."
"Absolutely uneducated staff. Weeks without a phone."
"On the 20th of March I decided to order a Xiaomi mi A2 lite, after a great deal of research and consideration. At first I was quite happy with my new smartphone. Sadly, that feeling faded away after a couple of months. More and more issues started to pop up, issues that are vital to standard smartphone use.-	Bluetooth is an absolute nightmare. It’ll connect with a device but the connection will stutter and make it impossible to enjoy listening to music through a bluetooth device.-	Wifi often disconnects and reconnects or there’s a bad connection. Which makes it impossible to have a pleasant videocall. -	Even basic apps are failing. The gallery app shuts down multiple times a day. (An app which I think is pre installed) New photos can’t be seen in the gallery app until it has shut down about two or three times in a row and even then I might not be able to see the new photos in the gallery. In this household I am the ONLY one to experience these issues with my phone. Everything works perfectly on other devices. People buy a smartphone once every four or five years, they do NOT however intend on spending money on a new phone every year. I am DONE with this phone. It’s not even a year old and I already experience major issues with basic, vital elements."
"Terrible promotion moves but fast delivery. They always break their own conditions regarding coupons etc. but delivery is still really fast and warranty works."
"Ordered a Mi Mix 3 5g phone from mi.com joining the april sales.The phone was on sale from 700£ to 239£ (I know on some places like O2 its 350£ so its not a big deal, but for example at vodafone its 700£as well).The phone was delivered the next day by DHL, perfect condition no damage on the parcel, no missing phone. Everything was perfect and I am very happy with the service and the price.I just wanted to leave this here after reading so many bad reviews.Thank you Xiaomi!"
"Bought a phone 6 months ago , sent it back and they said it was water damage ,I had it checked by 3rd party who confirmed there was no sign of water damage, live chat is a nightmare,they will not give me UK address , I have taken then to small claims ,but no reply from them from the address I did find,  100 Brook Drive, Green Park, Reading Rg2 6uj, Unit Part Ground Floor, North Wing, 100 Brook Drive, Green Park, Reading Rg2 6uj, United Kingdom, Reading, England, RG2 6UJ, I have now served ccj, I don't know what happens next ,I sent over 50 emails"
"Best Smartphone of the World. 499€ and the most Highend Staff you can get. Top Customer Service and very good Quality. Nothing bad to mention."
"Like many others, I ordered a phone and it never arrived. Currently trying to get a refund. The phone is still for sale, which is outrageous. Not much better than scammers."
"I recently got a new phone manufactured by redmi so called note 8. Less than a month I found the phone totally waste investment. It hang up frequently and sometimes even switch off during use!! I experienced that I've invested my money on a trash!!"
"1 Star is a star too many.. As with others, ordered phone, phone stolen in transit, empty box delivered, Xiaomi ask for Police reports, Statements, ID etc etc, promises of escalation to logistics blah blah blah.... in the end requested Credit Card Company step in, refund gained, still nothing back from Xiaomi. Avoid avoid avoid....."
"I woke up to find my phone stuck on the mi logo, tried to flash it to find out it's locked. Tried to contact their support to get some automatic chat bot with cookie cutter responses that are totally irrelevant. Most website pages are in Chinese and there is no English version. All of their support forums are filled with nonsense posts, and the only way to unlock the phone is to have their MI account which in order to do so will have access to your private data, which by the way I once sent them a basic GDPR mail asking about my PII which they had never responded too but kept asking silly questions as if they don't have my mail address in their database already. I'm basically now staring at my bricked phone with nothing much to do while being left in a chicken and egg situation as I needed this phone the most during COVID-19.."
"2 times my scooter needs to repair it has not even run 20km it is simply too bad with so expensive a product it is a 365 pro scooter that you can not even use Error 24 and 1 time it’s dont charge"
"Similar to the many other reviews on here (Which I wish I had seen before ordering - did not deliver product and terrible customer service. When phone did not arrive they required a copy of my ID and police report stating it was Lost from Met police. Utterly ridiculous and fraudulent! Not trust worthy at all, I will be starting the claim process via my bank and reporting them.If you are reading this because you have already placed an order, please report this company - if we don't all report them they will just continue.Stay far far away."
"DO NOT BUY FROM THESE THIEVES. FAILED TO COMPLY WITH UK SAFETY RECALL. Bought an electric M365 scooter, a notice came out that my scooter was of a series that was Unsafe to ride and a safety recall was issued by the government. They said they would collect it, repair it and delivery it back BUT if absolutely ANY phisical damage of any kind existed in the scooter, they would send me a quote for its repair and return delivery AND IF I DIDNT PAY IT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN THE SCOOTER TO ME. They told me that this included even a tire puncture! I have this in writing. I explained that I didn't need anything extra repaired, that this was a safety recall, and that under UK trading standards it had to be done at no cost to me. They said they could not just do the safety repair, that the presence of any other phisical damage would need to be paid. I ended up NOT sending them the scooter and now I have a faulty product as they would not agree to deal with the safety recall in a guaranteed free of charge manner. Disgusting customer service. Save yourself some grief and buy from a manufacturer that abides by UK law."
"Awful company lost my package and want me to send a stolen item report from the MET (I don't live in London and the item never made it to England) along with my ID! No chance. Credit card reclaim and complaint to ICO!"
"Ordered a phone. Never delivered. They want photo ID a police report and statement. This is when it never left France. What a customer service joke. When you chat with them they keep going on about the higher management who they tell me are in China. They want my details.I must say they are the worst company I've ever dealt with."
"Don't buy from Xiaomi(UK). They failed to deliver a phone, gave me incorrect tracking no for their courier ( twice), incorrect phone no too. They have admitted that the phone is with their courier in France but want me to report it lost to the Metropolitan Police, want my ID  and want a signed statement from me to say that I have not received.They wont accept a photocopy of my UK DL which has the same name and delivery address . Their customer services people send happy clappy messages from a script . They will not refund my money or pass on my complaint to someone senior.They claim to be Xiaomi( UK) but are registered in France. Their customer service for the UK may be based anywhere but the UK.They are not only breaking UK consumer law but any notion of a competent service.I suspect their team are not empowered to do anything but read or send trite lines from a script but are being "" rogue"" in not refering my complaint to more senior responsible people.Avoid. Their phones are good but buy from a phone co such as Three.If they lie in response to this, I will publish all correspondence."
"Mi shop London.   Very fast delivery.  Phone arrived sealed and well packaged.   Great Phone better than expected. Very easy to set up. Customer service polite and very helpful. Highly recommended"
"Like others, ordered a phone from their UK website, promised a 5 day delivery time from warehouse in France, phone still in transit 15 days later.Customer services very polite but of no use. Requested a refund but asked to send a photo of my driving license (why? That opens me up for identity theft with my name, address, date of birth), a written statement with signature (you've not delivered the phone, the tracking link you supplied clearly shows it is still with your courier, Colissimo, in France). And then the most pointless of all they want a PDF of the Met Police website help information, not even a crime reference number, not that there has been a crime that the police would get involved.Claiming back through my credit card company now as failed to deliver item and will not provide a refund.I would advise NOT ordering off their Mi.com website."
"I count myself as one of the Lucky ones and received my phone intact but can only give 1 star if there is out and out fraudulent behaviour with this company and there French couriers. Anyone wanting a xiaomi phone should visit Gearbest in Hong Kong as I have ordered multiple items of them in the past including phones and never missed a delivery even though it may of taken a little longer than a week to get to me."
"I've bought a Xiaomi Mi Box S.I've upgraded via OTA to Android 9. After the upgrade vocals commands, Chromecast and other stuff stopped working!Not a serious company for sure. No more Mi products for me!"
"Do not buy direct from this company at least until they change the courier company they use. I ordered a phone and I received an empty box. 4 weeks after the empty box was delivered I am still waiting for a refund and the customer service is terrible. Please don't put your selves through the stress of this FRAUD!!!!"
"I asked to order a Xiaomi Mi Box S remote as my dog broke mine. I told them outright that I would pay for one and they said they would send me a paypal request when they are available. I have hence followed up every two weeks to get the status only to be told that they do not have them yet. It is now 6 MONTHS in and after email after email they tell me that they are very rare and will not receive one til they get some in stock. So I don't know if I will ever get a new remote. I asked if they still manufacture them and they said they do. I asked them if I can send my entire unit and they can send me a new one back and they said they cannot. I have now told everyone of my family members (8 in total who all wanted to buy a mi box s) that it was not worth the issues in case something happens. I urge you not support a company that doesn't care about their customers."
"I like the phones, but my package got nicked in France and I never saw it.  This means I have to claim and go through all the hassle of it and all the emails I sent to the support which I have received nothing like satisfactory help with. (apparently I have to raise a Met Police Number, even though it is a crime in France?)  If i buy a phone It will be from a third party, though this would make me worry if i had a warranty issue I wouldn't get it back."
"21.2.20Ordered mi box s , an empty box arrived.Keep asking for my order.they keep saying unrelated things.This is must be the worst customer service one has to deal with.2nd of May 2020 edit:Lost count how long it's been .About 10 weeks and no refund yet.They keep saying 24 hours to hear from their logistics, since February!No disrespect,but they brought a local organisation to  deal with a global market.A sad joke from beginning to end."
"Was very worried with reviews about empty boxes being delivered but order was delivered in well sealed undamaged box. Ordered Monday delivered Saturday, very pleased.  Only comment, tracking didn't update until day of delivery.  Really happy with phone too."
"I ordered a phone that came with a free fitness tracker off their site and it arrived promptly in the post. The products were protected very well in the packaging as well."
"Probably the worst customer service dept you could ever deal with. I had a fairly simple request, to have someone pick up the faulty set of body composition scales I ordered and return a new one. Called them 3 times, they promised the same thing 3 times, never heard from them after each time. Still stuck with these dodgy scales. Regretting leaving Apple at this point.."
"Ordered xiaomi phone in UK and empty box arrived.ABSOLUTE JOKE! This has happened to many customers so I do not understand why are they not taking preventive MEASURES for empty boxes. Do something with your courier service. Imagine if the delivery had to be signed by one of my neighbours. I hate to say this but I had to doubt my neighbours for your incompetence. Thank goodness I was home! Your products are nice and affordable but it is not worth it...if I have to pay £399 to sign and receive an empty box!"
"Tragic customer service, still chasing a response since November last year. Poor language and response messaging, new persons every time I contact them. No resolution. Embarrassing all round. Would never deal with them again cannot believe someone of this calibur has customer service levels so poor."
"I purchased a phone with them, that arrived in a broken box at the collection centre. The situation of the parcel was so bad that the shop keeper who was meant to accept it refused to take it, to avoid responsibility for the damage. I have been promised a refund after a really cumbersome phone call where the operator wanted to convince me I had to ask for the refund to the courier company (totally false). They confirmed that the refund would have been processed within a deadline, after which no money arrived in my bank account.I have then called the customer service, that told me that they are putting an investigation on my case, whilst another operator by e-mail was asking me my details to process the refund again, as if I never applied for it. They don't play by the rules, they don't have the minimum shame and don't seem to realise that what you write in an e-mail is legally binding and you cannot change the deadline of a refund as you please.I seriously don't recommend this company, their customer service is appalling, shocking and utterly unprofessional, also, the courier Colissimo UK chosen by them is awful (check it on Trustpilot)."
"Same old story as you can see from other reviews, empty box arrived, got rejected, then spend months trying to get a refund. Why don't the change the courier company?Do yourself a favour, go somewhere else."
"BEWAREI had ordered a phone from Xiaomi UK via rhe mi.com website. Their choice of courier services are corrupt. The package which should have been signed for had been left outside my flat, had been signed for by the DPD delivery guy himself rather than myself and then when actually inspecting the package I could see it had been tampered with. The package lacked the phone - it was stolen. They informed me that they have had a high number of phone thefts via their delivery company (Collissimo/DPD).Xiaomi UK customers services are one of the worst I have ever experienced, I ve had a representative put the phone down on me, one of their managers ""Jennifer"" who only works on a Friday insulting me over the telephone call, misinformation about when I will get my refund and a number of delaying techniques for example informing me that my refund should be in my bank account on a particular day, then stating my bank has been querying this, then stating it takes 5-7 working days to process then saying that the Xiaomi UK refund department are on holiday in China despite the company being registered in France - ALL LIES!Honestly, I would never recommend using this company - if you have any issues with your order or product you will be lied to, insulted and ignored. Definitely not worth the hassle of buying with them, consider a third party seller with a reputable background instead - AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!"
"The worst customer support ever. The Xiaomi global support doesn't seem to give a crap about your issues. Most importantly, they don't even pretend to be caring about you."
"Todays morning 10:20 am my mobile mi redmi 6A Blastadress -at/po Parjang,dist-Dhenkanal,pin-759120,state-Odishamob-7978380989"
"Seriously appalling customer service.  Make it very difficult to get help via online chat.  And then they never carry out what they promise.  Don’t get back to you. I spent £450 on an m365 scooter and they didn’t want to know when it stopped working after 2 months."
"The best phone i have owned incredibly low prices,you can keep your Samsung's and iPhones.The after sales service is second to none."
"Stay away from buying any thing from them. They take the money and if something goes wrong ,they don't give u any support if the item was missed , broken or make it easy for a refund I brought a phone more than a month ago, and still,there is no phone or refund from them.its being a night mare"
"worst ever company I came across, I bought some stuff from them back in Dec 19, turned out to be rubbish and not fit for purpose so returned them and since then I am back and forth chasing them up for a refund, today is 15 of Jan 20 and still no refund, I have now filed a dispute with my credit company, these Chinese company are quick on taking your money but not as when returning it in fact they do not return it all!"
"This review is based on official online community, given by a team feedback member.I was asking about the feature mirrorlink that allows us to connect the phone to the car radio (hint is car radio), to display the phone screen contents on your car radio. Like Samsung, alcatel and many others allow. Easy to understand, right? Well, a team member replies with the option of miracast/screen cast to TELEVISIONS! do they even know English? Hey, I'm not English either but I suppose I was easily understandable."
"Don’t buy from Xiaomi online uk store, ordered phone and has never arrived, currently in transit for 44 days. Xiaomi are polite but don’t actually help; they asked me to follow up with the courier and the police, even though it is their responsibility!Luckily, got a refund from my credit card company. Avoid!"
"I have xiaomi 8 mi pro no cases for this model only transparent. Why making a phone without basic accesories maybe they forgot that they made this modelShame, next time i will stick to popular and my personal favourite samsung"
"Just bought a selfie stick the day before Christmas.   Came several days later to exchange it for a Bluetooth version but they were out of stock.  Then instead of providing a refund they only give a voucher to buy something else.  Although the design looks good really disappointing after sale service.  Also bought last year  2 pens from them in the past but both broke within a couple of days.  Thought at the time it was just bad luck but looking at some of their product reviews does not seem they care about the quality and hence lack of after sale care.Finally they don’t accept Amex, typical of low quality shops."
"I bought a Xiaomi and it is 13 months old.  Firstly, the correct software was not put on my phone so after a few months it wouldn't download, so I had to reboot it to take it back to factory settings. However, there are 2 other issues with the phone.  The first is that it can take a while to charge and then runs down in 2 hours.  I play Scrabble a lot otherwise I am just on Facebook.  The other issue is that it has been saying for the past 2 months that it is running out of space.  I have never had this happen before with any of the phones I have.  I think Xiaomi is a dishonest company and I would never buy a phone from them again."
"Mi website and his delivery service is very bad. Don't buy anything from mi store"
"world best service and very helpfull popele ,i very satisfide with mi"
"DO NOT buy from Xiaomi website. Empty parcel arrived and still almost 5 months to get refunded, hoping i will get refunded one day.. They keep saying the have escalated the issue again... week after week, no news from them."
"I wish I could leave a minus 5.    My device lasted 7 months, the original seller did not respond to my warranty claim.  Regional reseller did not want to help.  Global customer service could not even SELL me the parts I needed to repair.  Thats right - Global head office can't even SELL THE PARTS for a 7 month old device.    Xiaomi customer service is usless , sending back canned email templates saying they can't help. Not once, not twice..... but 4 times, the same template email back to my reply.  You would not read about it.  I really regret buying Xiaomi, and I will NEVER buy this brand again - honestly the worse experience I have actually ever had.Hey Xiaomi, I hope you read this review - you could get your ""Customer Lack of Service Team"" to send me another template email saying how you can't help me.  I am now throwing your 7 month old piece of junk in the bin.  Goodbye forever Xiaomi."
"My wife bought a RedmI Note 6 pro mobile phone just over a year ago via Gearbest.  Today the phone has stopped working. We contacted Mi.com and via chat the operator Adam, was very polite but after taking the Imei number said it was out of warranty and was bought through a non authorised dealer: Gearbest, so could do nothing to help. A warning to others looking to buy one of these makes!"
"This time am not satisfied with Mi the company they are providing Ecom express are not supportive and even the delivery boy not picked a call once and the message dropped on my phone that your shipment address was unlocatable...not even the boy picked up a call or called me atleast once for the address."
"Best phone brand , you must understand, ask for the policy warranty to get better understanding on how warranty works"
"Great products but absolutely awful customer service.  They don't respond & when they do you just go around in circles with the same mindless responses.  I cannot believe how truly awful their customer service is.  If you want a company that provides after sales support & service don't choose this one!"
"The customer support answers with some generic ""We are sorry blablabla can't help blablabla"" even though the question I had was very simple: I wanted to know whether or not the authentication site I got redirected to when trying to validate their fuggin product was their domain or not (because I thought I was scammed and the domain had some strange spelling mistakes). So funny when they implement such an authentication stuff in the first place but when you have a concern regarding the authenticity of your product they don't give a shat.After three more mails with their ""Hello my name is blabla, I'm sorry blabla, please contact the point of sale"" response (which doesn't make any sense when I got scammed by the point of sale) I told them they are fagoats. I will now proceed to order some emission heavy product from their shiiiethole country and hope to increase pollution in that shieeetty shieet place full of shietteded shieeeters even more. How does it feel waking up and not seeing your own duck due to polluted air? ""Aaaah whee may diiik, not seeee.""Edit: Ok, ordered a bunch of plastic figures that I don't need."
"Hello I Am Athul.from india-kerala. my phone no-9995102936. I've been using Redmi Note 5 Pro Mobile for one year and Redmi Note 5 Pro is the best mobile I've ever used.recently had an incident because the Redmi Note 5 Pro is the best phone I've ever used. As I was riding my bike, the phone sliped from my hand and the bike went up, got off the phone and fell into the water. immediately turned off the phone and set the phone on after three hours. The phone's display has exploded. Then the phone became a bend and I thought the phone was no longer useful. But now I use the Redmi phone as conditioner. I am very happy to use the Redmi phone. But I am a bit worried right now I want to pick up the Redmi New Model phone. But I can't get this phone exchanged. When the phone is exchanged, the display is broken and the phone bend is very probable. Because of that, I can't do phone exchange. I can still use the phone as a good condition because of the phone's body quality and display quality. I want to exchange Redmi's for a new phone. So your business is asking you to make an option.pls help."
"I have Xiaomi nearly a year now, the phone is ok for the price but every so often it zooms in on stuff of it's own accord, so I tried to put it to factory reset, Xiaomi told me they'd send me a code to my email address and phone number, I've tried this several times but they never respond to my email or phone number with the code so at this stage ive given up on them, and I'm advising people to stay clear of this company, I'll be going back to Samsung the old reliable, Xiaomi your customer care are useless and you should sack the lot of them. A very annoyed EX Xiaomi customer.i can't understand how they get so good reviews, I read one review which gave them five star's but obviously they only had the phone for a week or two not over a long period anyway i will not be getting any money Xiaomi phones from now on and will advise my friends too stay clear of them as well."
"Absolutely horrible! This company is a scam, their service doesn't exist. They never respond to your emails or phones, I got their Bluetooth sports headphones which were useless the day I got them because they turn off automatically as the company sent a faulty piece. I would strongly advise everyone considering to buy from xiaomi, they are nothing but a waste of your money."
"Pathetically incompetent company. Their website is the worst I have ever encountered (and I have seen some real Turkeys in my time). Illogical, broken links - nothing good about it. When I entered my address, it kept rejecting it.Don't touch this company with a very long barge pole."
"I have a Redmi phone which has been deactived, therefore I contacted the company almost 2months ago to be advised it will be reactivated within 3 to 5 working days. It's now 2 months on and after chasing with numerous emails and phone calls still no progress. I've asked to speak to a manager, this was also refused."
"I received the incorrect item and it took 6 weeks for them to arrange a prepaid return only for them to send the exact same item back to me! After 2 months I have given up and have been attempting to arrange a refund but so far this process has been equally appalling.Update: I never got a refund. Each time I contacted them they treated it as if I was sending them a message for first time."
"the worst service ever I have met. mail was lost during delivery over 2 months and asked customer to contact policeman and delivery company. have you heard it!!! it should seller's responsibility!!! no refund or replacement!! reply is very slow, never solved the problem. I will never use it again!! really bad!!"
"Xiaomi is trying to scam customers and I have proof. I am missing a few items from my order and it has been ongoing for 3 months and they only send the same replies which is to be patient. They also lie and say they will get in touch within the week but never do. I am going to report them and upload a video regarding this issue as they are not following lawful protocol to solve customer problems. It has been months and Xiaomi have not resolved this issue at all."
"Awful experience.I ordered a phone only to receive an empty box! Like some other people reviewing here have reported.Xiaomi customer support has been terrible, just telling me they know about this problem and are ""escalating it"". It's been 3 weeks now and ive wasted hours of my time with phone calls and emails to them...They are repeating themeselves and asking for information about the missing phone again and again like robots which I have already provided to them.So far 4 different people from xiaomi customer service have been replying to my emails and I don't think any of them can communicate with each other or they have systems in place to store the information about my case. What a joke Hopefully after one month has passed I can get my bank to try and get my money back as I have no faith in Xiaomi helping me or giving me reimbursement.Please do yourselves a favor and do not use this company."
"Worst customer service I had to deal with in my entire life. The customer service manager promised to give me a call back to discuss my inquiry, it’s been 1 month now and I received nothing but the middle finger from the whole team.I am disgusted and disappointed for the amount of money I had spent in their store. They asked me to pay the reparation of my scooter hence this is out of the manufactureGuarantee :)))). Don’t buy Xioami!!!!!"
"The idea of an electric scooter, to transport me to and from work in London seemed to me the ideal solution - good for the environment, easy to use, fast through the busy London traffic and convenient to store. Unfortunately these advantages can only be enjoyed if the scooter actually switches on. For the first month of ownership, the scooter was perfect - this would be ideal if one could spend £400 a month for a new scooter. The handlebars started to become loose, I had countless punctures, despite riding on even surfaces, making riding feel somewhat unsafe, perhaps I should tell my work that I will probably be 30 minutes late every day due to some idiotic defect, meaning I have to carry the daft thing on the train, completely defeating the object of spending my money on this vehicle. Sounds bad? After a few more weeks, my xiaomi decided it would just stop working.I'm happy to accept that things go wrong, (rarely so spectacularly) so I decided to make use of the convenient free warranty. After emailing the company, a delayed reply instructed me to find my own box, at my own expense. After countless unsuccessful trips trying to find a box big enough for it, I gave up. Xiaomi very kindly agreed to send me their own box! Brilliant. However, I probably spent the same amount of money as the price of the scooter travelling whilst I waited for the delivery of the box. After a month without the scooter it was finally delivered back to me.Perhaps I should clarify here, the dictionary definition of warranty is as follows: ""a written guarantee, issued to the purchaser of an article by its manufacturer, promising to repair or replace it if necessary within a specified period of time.""(no time was specified, certainly not the age long wait that I had to endure) Anyway, overcome with relief that my mode of transport was returned, I set out to try my newly refurbished xiaomi. After a magnificent total of 50 metres, the xiaomi gave up the ghost and died once again.It is safe to say that I will now be searching for a new way of travelling around London.In conclusion, everyone should definitely buy the xiaomi!..."
"So far happy with the delivery time on my redmi k20 pro. I have no idea why most giving out bad review."
"Do not use this company. Absolutely abominable customer service. Purchased a Mi 9SE and within a week an innocuous bang had cracked the screen. As a result, I try and arrange a repair which on the face of it seemed easy: they log the repair with their repairs company and I receive a bag in the post to send off the phone, easy. Except, the bag never arrives. Receive an email from SBE (should have checked trust pilot - equally awful) stating they had no details of the logged repair and to recontact Xiaomi. Xiaomi couldn't understand, and told me to contact SBE, which is fine, if they ever answer their phones.Three phone calls later, many vacuous apologies, and still no solution. They have offered to re-log the repair and can't understand why nothing is happening. I am now at the ""escalation"" stage which from other reviews is apparently equally as useless.I am now in the ether of Xiaomi only using this firm, and the firm not responding to any form of communication.I have decided to give up and write off the phone. I don't trust this firm to be responsible with the product and I have learnt never to buy anything from Xiaomi."
"Ordered a device, came within 10 days happy with it."
"THEY KNOW NOTHING, the customer support of XiaoMi is horrible, they know nothing about anything, they never solve any problem and they think doing the things as they do in china (where noone knows about what other ppl do even in the same company) will work in the world??? gosh yo really need to think a little, this customer suport is awful, the wrost."
"Tried buying a new phone on the mi.com uk site and the card payment failed. Found out the next day when I phoned my credit card company, that the card was auto declined as it was a ""High risk"" website, so the card was automatically cancelled,  just as well as they had as they said there had been several attempts to use the details since it was cancelled. Fortunately no money had been taken. Either they are dodgy as hell or their systems have been compromised."
"Purchased a redmi A2 nearly 6 weeks ago,Due to be delivered by DPD, delivery van and contents stolen on day of delivery, still waiting for replacement item or refund, shocking customer service, great products.Update-Just received refund, approximately 8 weeks after purchase date.Be aware.Absolutely appalling customer service."
"They ran a promotion for half price bluetooth earphones with free delivery for 24 hours only, however the free delivery wouldn't apply. Their chat acknowledged this was a website error but refused to fix it within the time frame of the offer, making it impossible to use the promotion. If ordering is this hard then I dread to think what after sales support will be like!"
"Very poor I'll never use Xiaomi again. My experience is similar to others who have reviewed. Ordered a power bank charger with never arrived. Customer Service is rubbish, just keeps coming back saying that they are escalating the issue - I think it is an automated system.After 4 months of requesting replacement or refund, I have given up and getting the credit card provider to sort it out using a ""Chargeback"". Watch out though, you only have 120 days from original expected date of delivery to report the problem."
"oh dear, this doesn't look promising looking at the other reviews.  I also ordered phones from the Xiaomi UK site, but one didn't turn up.  Have had no help at all from Customer Services except a promise to ""escalate"" the situation. But it has now been a month, and no refund or replacement phone. Avoid."
"I tried to order a night light using their phone app on 6th April 2019, but I kept getting an error message regarding payment. After four unsuccessful attempts I gave up. An hour later i received three email order confirmations totalling £40.  I reported the problem IMMEDIATELY, but by the time they responded several days later the items had already been shipped. They emailed me back and said simply wait for the items and they'll send me return jiffy bags which I can post the items back in.  This is where the problem started, after half a dozen emails with customer support over a 4 week period, they kept saying they'd send the return jiffy bags.  The customer service team are clearly not based in the UK, their English is broken and to be honest I don't think they understood.  Two months later after another loads of emails, finally someone who spoke english called me and said they had no idea why I was waiting for jiffy bags (although I have several emails from 6 different customer service teams members confirming this).  They said they'd email printable prepaid postage stamps, which came about a week later on email.I then sent them back, and another week later they said the items were fine and they'd process the refund.  I'v now checked my balance on my card and after 3 months of waiting (I ordered on the 6th April) they refunded me the grand total of 9 pence.  Seriously, what kind of people work there? Madness!!!The products are amazing, but if anything goes wrong you are royally screwed.  I would never order from this company ever again.  Going back to Apple products."
"Awful service. I have been chasing a refund over a month now, live chat advise they will look into and provide updates but they never do.  Have had to escalate via credit card company"
"Shame on you.... Order was incomplete, zero customer service, never again...."
"Worst customer service after  3 mobile phone company in the UK. Won't give you information,  emails in Chinese only,  no complaints procedure,  arrogant representatives,  copy and paste emails...  Repetitive and confusing. Only go to xiaomi if you have money to burn 😡"
"Still waiting on my refund buyers beware avoid them and look else ware."
"Very bad customer service. Left me without a scooter for months. My scooter snapped in half when i was ridding on the main road. I have made hundreds of phone calls and emails,. They took my scooter and are refusing to give a new scooter although they has said that all the models that i have have been recalled due to manufacturer fault. they are refusing to give me anew scooter, but are adamant on repairing my scooter. I have been hung up on and been sent to department to department and as of today nothing has been resolved. I will never recommend this company. The worst service ever."
"I now have 4 Xiaomi products. Mi band 3, Smart Scales, Redmi Airdots and the MI9. Love them all for such a bargain. I purchased all through Ali-express so haven't experiences any customer service direct from Xiaomi yet but all i can say is that their products are great and especially for the price."
"Poor service. No refund for non-delivered package. Awful company."
"First let me say that I'm very happy with my Xiaomi products having owned many for years.  However, I would strongly advise against buying directly from them as their customer service is abysmal.  They repeatedly ignored my requests, didn't read emails properly/fully, wouldn't honour an offer on the site that first worked then didn't and when I asked them (well before despatch) to not send the product and cancel it they sent it anyway and expected me to pay the return postage!  I don't think that the customer service operators are at fault - although they aren't at all helpful - but the procedures are so poorly designed and rigid have no way whatsoever to deal with queries.  The point of a customer service department is to help customers and protect the relationship between them and the company.  In the case of Xiaomi this hasn't been understoon at all by the company and has damaged that relationship instead.The end result is that I could have got the same product from a UK retailer cheaper than direct and it would have come much quicker.  I could send it back, give in and pay postage to Xiaomi but I honestly don't have the faith in their ability to process the return so (as I'm sure they planned all along) it's easier to keep it.    This has been the most frustratingly poor customer service experience I've had in a long time - so bad in fact that I'm here warning about it......"
"I own 2 XiaoMi products, a Mi Mix 2 and their portable charger. Very good quality products and well priced. Love them."
"I bought a new Redmi 6A phone recently. Cheap entry level smart phone that works well. No regrets!"
"Ordered a phone off of Xiaomi UK, their delivery partner Colissimo have stolen the phone during transit and replaced it with 2 packs of business cards!"
"Perfect smartphone for such a low price. I bought redmie 5 and it is great."
"Such poor customer service.I bought my M365 scooter from the MI store in westfield 3 months ago. 1 month later the scooter started making a horrible creaking noise. I took it back into store for a warranty repair or replacement. The Mi store sent it to a separate company to check. Then they sent me a bill for a £96 repair as the claimed the repair was out of warranty.I eventually gave in and agreed to pay as they threatened to destroy the scooter if i didn't. After emailing to say to go ahead i have heard nothing for over a week now. The customer support team are unable to contact the store directly as the store apparently do not have a phone. How can a store operate like this?!This is by far the worst service i have received. I will never me buying another again."
"I had contacted Xiaomi over the past few months since the Xiaomi Mi9 Smartphone was launched in China on 20 February, and in Europe on 24 February asking for when it was due to be released in the UK.  Since then it has been on sale in France, Spain and Italy – and finally, a few days ago your social media accounts brought me the news that finally, it would be released in the UK (today).However, despite this well-advertised announcement, you can understand my disappointment when I login to their UK website and the Vodaphone (who will be the first to stock it) website only to discover it is still not available to buy. I then contacted them on the chat function and a helpful person  told me that they are still waiting for an update from your website team and from Vodaphone and to give you another week to work on it. (copy of chat attached) How can a company promote the launch of its own product (one of which has been released in other parts of Europe since February) and then not have everything in place to launch it on a given date? On a side note I also visited a Vodaphone store on Monday to see if they had one on display to have a look at and to confirm it would be available from today…and none of the staff had even heard of it – let alone being able to tell me when it would be available!I am extremely disappointed and will be voicing all of this on social media until the matter is resolved / or clearer clarification is offered as to when the Mi 9 will be available and from where."
"I don't like the fact that if you're living in the UK you can't install any themes because of region restriction whatever...I've got a MI 5 Plus for 1 year now, got it for £125 New, I've had many Samsung phones but since the prices went higher I've decided to buy something cheaper and with the same specs at that time ; Octa core, 3gb RAM and a whopping 32gb storage haha.I've managed to break the screen and I found £15 replacement display on a chinese website, how amazing. Cheap fix did it myself.For that money I've got no complaint's , incredible value-price product. p.s: still waiting for dark modeThank you."
"mi A1,12 months old,suddlenly developes a black screen,no reply from customer services,no online help,not even any type of response to acknowledge they received my concerns.Yes,cheap products but if outside china or India avoid this brand as help is no existant"
"Poor customer service that takes a long time to resolve any issues"
"Xiaomi has Worst customer service in india.Authorised service centres don't know to find root cause of the issue. For new mobiles they say fluid issue hence not covered in warrantyFor mobiles out of warranty ( after 1 YEAR) , they tell its a mother board issue and need to replace mother board"
"I never understood why Xiaomi has bad reviews. Their products are really cheap and decent. I have been using their Mi Max phone for awhile and it is really good for its price. I have no issues with the phone I'm using and I hope it continues to stay that way!"
"Xiaomi! Phone might be good but Mi Protect is pure Fraud with company like One assist , they have N number of excuses to dis approve your genuine claim"
"Actually I collect the coin from mi app and redeem them but didn't received my prize"
"I have a Redmi Note 5 and I Can't play Fortnite but i have 64-bits and Android 8.1.0.Please add fortnite to Redmi Note 5"
"best high quality products"
"I love Xiaomi products! I have their MiBox, MiBand and a smartphone and I couldn't be happier! High end quality with low end prices! My next purchase will be their robotic vacuum cleaner and I can't wait!"
"Xiaomi's 20k power bank is so good and it's very affordable. Charges my phone so quickly and I can do multiple charges too. Great product!"
"Thank you for your products. I've been using your smartphones and power banks for 3 years till now. I'm so happy with it. I didn't have issues with the hardware, there were some troubles with the software but I understand that nothing is perfect. I wish you all the best. Keep doing great product!"
"I'm feeling really let down Xiaomi because I have always been one of the biggest advocators of your products. That was until my order of a Mi Band 3 on 26th November (Order ID #5181126373160147) which after several patiently worded emails STILL hasn't shown up!! This was ordered for a Christmas present which the disappointed and upset recipient is still waiting for now. The last thing I was told was ""we still don't have any updates"" on the 4th of January and I've had no response at all to my last message on the 7th which just isn't good enough. I just want you to send me my goods I've paid for and give a proper response from customer services to let me know what's going on because right now I'm feeling pretty disheartened by the whole experience. ☹️EDIT: 06/12/2019 Never received this item at all in the end. Every time I spoke with them all they told me was it was delivered by their courier. Initially when I complained they asked me to wait, and I waited so long just to be treated like a liar without investigation as to where their courier actually did deliver my item, and too long I couldn't do a chargeback either with my card. BEWARE!!!"
"If you need a powerbank, buy the Xiaomi 20k one. Long, durable, not too big, fast charge, and with that ammount of MAH you can almost charge your car on it!"
"Have bought alot of Xiaomi products, from Phones to Powerbanks, and they never fail to deliver on the quality department!"
"Xiaomi provides the best eletronic equipments for the cheapest price on the market. Even tho they are from china, the quality is unmatched!"
"Xiaomi is great products for middle class people. The products last long and are cheap. Once upon a time people find it hard to encounter any less cost mobile accessories but Xiaomi made it possible."
"Fully satisfied with my purchase, really cheap and charges really fast. Xiaomi really provides good equipment for cheap prices!"
"This is ideal combination of the price and power! Redmi 6 smartphone model is perfect. For a bit more then 100 pounds you have great device with powerful option. This device worth money paid! The only thing is missed as for me NFC support."
"Average.. cheep prices but sometimes the product fall apart..."
"Wether it be cellphones, powerbanks or other equipment, Xiaomi provides these high quality products at ridiculously competitive prices! Unmatched on the market!"
"Xiaomi provides the best cellphones arround at unbelievably low prices! They have insanely good speccs for the kind of prices they put on those phones, and their customer service is spot on!"

"I use the Xiaomi Mi A1 smartphone - absolute perfection. Great performances, amazing price, and it feels really high-end although it's on the cheaper pricing scale. Haven't had a single issue as of yet, and I recommended it to my family members and they couldn't be happier."
"I've got a problem with battery adapter few days after my purchase, so it've been in 7 days garantee to change the new one. But after sending the adapter to Repair Service Center in Thailand, Pantip branch in Bangkok. It seems disappear because I almost have no idea about that at all. I tried to call several times, but no response, so I had to go there in person. And staff at the service center just told me that Xiaomi was changine thier system so that part would be to arrive. Today is only 3 weeks after I sent that part to the service center, and it's 2 weeks after last time I went there in person."
"Actually, the best smartphone brand. Great quality."
"Absolutely love their products! Been running on Mi6 for well over a year now and it is performing as a brand new phone. True value for money purchase... highly recommended"
"Bad experience! Purchased the Mi A2 Lite is full of bugs starting with AndroidAuto that does not work right! Contacted the assistance never answered anyone. I will never again recommend this company to anyone!Pessima esperienza! Acquistato il Mi A2 Lite è pieno di bug a cominciare da AndroidAuto che non funziona proprio! Contattata l'assistenza non ha mai risposto nessuno. Non consiglierò mai più a nessuno questa azienda!"
"I have a Redmi 4 and a MI Band 2.The Redmi 4 had malware installed directly from the producer, while the MI Band 2 lost the light after the latest firmware upgrade.There are no answers on the MIUI forums, nothing that can be found online.The customer support is a joke as well.Deff do not recommend"
"Great online site with good products.. Xiaomi Car DVR was my first Purchace from Banggood. But unfortunately received the package with wrong items. The support team was kind enough to acknowledge this and assured to ship the correct package with in 24hrs. I am waiting for the product to come. Feel so happy and will definitely recommend banggood"
"The previous generation of Xiaomi were good but the new phones are absolutely trash. Bought a redmi 5, a few days later it fell from my bed and the LCD went.I have checked online and there are stress tests that show that the phone is extremely fragile and poorly built. The company I bought the phone from will not accept a return.Avoid Xiaomi phones at all costs."
"I have been buying my phone from China for years now. I have tried various brands with varying degrees of happiness. Typically the phones are good, but have had some issues lately with Ulefone brand phones. As a result I decided to try out the MI (Xiaomi) phones recently. I just wish I had converted to Xiaomi sooner. I bought two Redmi Note 5A devices and have also ordered a higher spec Xiaomi Redmi 5 model. The phones themselves are very well made and nice to use and hold. The UI is very well designed and intuitive and the features loaded as default are brilliant. The frequency and standard of the software updates provided by Xiaomi is very good, in fact they are way better at this than any of the other smartphone manufacturer I have tried from China. All in all I think the quality and support from Xiaomi and the value for money of their phones is fantastic. I am very much a fan now and will only buy MI from now on. Thanks. PS: I am not being paid or incentivised in anyway to write this report, I just think good service and value for money should be recognised as well as highlighting poor service etc."
"Works fine if you don't deviate from factory settings.  Probably fine in pure Chinese setting as it seems to have problems with many apps or backgrounds or personal modules.  I mean official apps/modules as available in the official store or directly proposed on the Xiaomi phone. So buy if u live in China and use Chinese.  Or learn advanced phone setup technology."
"Reasonable price for the good quality. Looking forward to see samples of mi laser projector. It promising to be like a hit."
